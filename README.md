# PlaylistGuide-LLM
An LLM Chatbot which assists the user with answering questions about and finding locations of content in a Youtube Playlist

## Problem Statement
Playlists can be quite long and finding the exact location of content can be tedious. This project aims to assist users with finding the locations (video and timestamp) of specific content and be able to answer questions about the content in a given playlist.
