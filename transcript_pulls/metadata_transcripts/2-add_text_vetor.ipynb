       "  'text': \"retrieval generation and I think I made it toway here augmented so what it means is generation there are two two things that are interesting here generation and retrieval so we use retrieval to augment generation so retrieval is nothing else but search and generation is llm so llms generate text and they use search to augment the generation of this text what exactly does it mean so I have a few examples why we need track why do we need to augment Our Generation search so let's see yeah so these are the example so I have asked a question uh to chpt and the question is how do I cook cell one and then this is a straightforward question CH GPT gives a very comprehensive answer right so um like there is a lot of uh ways to cook Salman like five quite a lot right so this is a perfect example when we don't need search like we have a question llm knows the answer and llm gives us the answer but what if we want to ask it about the course so ask is it too late for me to join the course right but the llm has no idea what we talk about like which course is it too late what what does it mean exactly right and then it says I can help you but I need to know more details right so can you tell me more about that and the reason we want to use search is actually to answer that to give it more information to give it more context such that the llm is able to give the answer right and this is another example like how do I enroll in the course again it has no clue what we ask about but like it just give some answer that is nonsense right um another good example where we use uh we use uh retrieval also in chbt is we can ask it uh look up in  how to enroll in data engineering Zoom camp and so here we give it explicitly an instruction to uh perform a search and then based on the results of the search give us the answer so this is an example of rack so we augment the generation with the context we get from search and this is similar more similar to what we are going to build um this instruction is quite good okay so let me go back here so search is the first component of rock so we have like some sort of knowledge base and then the other component is the actual llm and then um just remove that um so we have two components knowledge base andm and let's say we have a user the user the student of the course or I don't know just the user if if we talk about our example it could be a student if we talk about some other example could be just user and the user has a question like how do I enroll in the course so this question let me call it Q so in rck what we do first is we send this query or the question to the knowledge base and the knowledge base has some article so this is our FAQ is a knowledge base space right so it has um some articles some answers some questions and answers to these questions so it could be like how do I enroll in the course there are some uh entries they talk about that so we retrieve these entries and then later so let's say these are the documents uh I'll call them T1 uh D2 Etc D5 right so let's say we retrieve five documents so these documents now have the context so remember I showed you example how do I enroll in the course or how like is it too late to join the course the llm has no idea but now these documents they provide the context for llm to figure out the right answer so now using the documents we do a prompt we create a prompt so let me just reuse uh this prompt so now we put this prompt and the context becomes uh these documents D1 Etc D5 right so these are the documents we received and now we send this prompt to the llm so llm receives the prompt it has the question it has the context and now based on the question and the context it can generate answer which we now we return to the user so this is the answer we sent so this is what I call the raack framework like how exactly we use a database knowledge base we can just call it database and LM together in order to accomplish what we want here how do we add context to our queries right so this is the rack framework and actually this database and this llm can be anything so for example in the course in this particular module we first will use a toy search engine like it will be a super simple search engine just to illustrate the idea but then later in the same module we will replace this search engine with elastic search and later in the course we will replace uh we will not just use text search but we will use some other uh ways of searching in particular Vector search so this thing here it can be anything like it doesn't have to be one specific technology in this framework you can easily replace them with another tool and see what works better and the same goes with llm so in this module we will use open AI but it doesn't have to be open AI you can use some open source llm and you just replace one with another you will of course need to tweak The Prompt because different lamps expect the like they they want the prompts to be a little bit different and that's all so we have the framework we replace uh or we put we insert some particular database some particular uh llm we see how it works and then at the end of the course we will also put this in some nice UI like stream Le or something like that so this is what you are going to learn and this is what you're are going to do and then at the end of the course you will Implement something like that on your own knowledge base so I'm really looking forward to the course and uh yeah have fun and uh yeah next we'll talk about uh preparing the environment\",\n",

       "  'text_vector': \"LLM Zoomcamp 1.1 - Introduction to LLM and RAG retrieval generation and I think I made it toway here augmented so what it means is generation there are two two things that are interesting here generation and retrieval so we use retrieval to augment generation so retrieval is nothing else but search and generation is llm so llms generate text and they use search to augment the generation of this text what exactly does it mean so I have a few examples why we need track why do we need to augment Our Generation search so let's see yeah so these are the example so I have asked a question uh to chpt and the question is how do I cook cell one and then this is a straightforward question CH GPT gives a very comprehensive answer right so um like there is a lot of uh ways to cook Salman like five quite a lot right so this is a perfect example when we don't need search like we have a question llm knows the answer and llm gives us the answer but what if we want to ask it about the course so ask is it too late for me to join the course right but the llm has no idea what we talk about like which course is it too late what what does it mean exactly right and then it says I can help you but I need to know more details right so can you tell me more about that and the reason we want to use search is actually to answer that to give it more information to give it more context such that the llm is able to give the answer right and this is another example like how do I enroll in the course again it has no clue what we ask about but like it just give some answer that is nonsense right um another good example where we use uh we use uh retrieval also in chbt is we can ask it uh look up in  how to enroll in data engineering Zoom camp and so here we give it explicitly an instruction to uh perform a search and then based on the results of the search give us the answer so this is an example of rack so we augment the generation with the context we get from search and this is similar more similar to what we are going to build um this instruction is quite good okay so let me go back here so search is the first component of rock so we have like some sort of knowledge base and then the other component is the actual llm and then um just remove that um so we have two components knowledge base andm and let's say we have a user the user the student of the course or I don't know just the user if if we talk about our example it could be a student if we talk about some other example could be just user and the user has a question like how do I enroll in the course so this question let me call it Q so in rck what we do first is we send this query or the question to the knowledge base and the knowledge base has some article so this is our FAQ is a knowledge base space right so it has um some articles some answers some questions and answers to these questions so it could be like how do I enroll in the course there are some uh entries they talk about that so we retrieve these entries and then later so let's say these are the documents uh I'll call them T1 uh D2 Etc D5 right so let's say we retrieve five documents so these documents now have the context so remember I showed you example how do I enroll in the course or how like is it too late to join the course the llm has no idea but now these documents they provide the context for llm to figure out the right answer so now using the documents we do a prompt we create a prompt so let me just reuse uh this prompt so now we put this prompt and the context becomes uh these documents D1 Etc D5 right so these are the documents we received and now we send this prompt to the llm so llm receives the prompt it has the question it has the context and now based on the question and the context it can generate answer which we now we return to the user so this is the answer we sent so this is what I call the raack framework like how exactly we use a database knowledge base we can just call it database and LM together in order to accomplish what we want here how do we add context to our queries right so this is the rack framework and actually this database and this llm can be anything so for example in the course in this particular module we first will use a toy search engine like it will be a super simple search engine just to illustrate the idea but then later in the same module we will replace this search engine with elastic search and later in the course we will replace uh we will not just use text search but we will use some other uh ways of searching in particular Vector search so this thing here it can be anything like it doesn't have to be one specific technology in this framework you can easily replace them with another tool and see what works better and the same goes with llm so in this module we will use open AI but it doesn't have to be open AI you can use some open source llm and you just replace one with another you will of course need to tweak The Prompt because different lamps expect the like they they want the prompts to be a little bit different and that's all so we have the framework we replace uh or we put we insert some particular database some particular uh llm we see how it works and then at the end of the course we will also put this in some nice UI like stream Le or something like that so this is what you are going to learn and this is what you're are going to do and then at the end of the course you will Implement something like that on your own knowledge base so I'm really looking forward to the course and uh yeah have fun and uh yeah next we'll talk about uh preparing the environment Welcome to the first module of our course, LLM Zoomcamp! We cover the applications of LLM, focusing on RAG: retrieval augmented generation. Throughout the course, we will build a Q&A system using the FAQ data from our courses. We don't cover the theory behind LLMs, but we will learn how to utilize them effectively.\",\n",

I highlight the process of finding and using these models, emphasizing the importance of benchmarks and performance leaderboards.

many employees does Apple have the moment you search for this Google understands that you're talking about the company Apple so it ranks its results based on that information that it found about your query similarly if you search for a another term let's say where can I pick apples near me in this context Google understood that the apples that you're referring to in this case are fruits and because of fruits it understood that you need to you need a location where you can go and pick up pick up the fruits how does Google does this it does it by using the semantic search because it's just not purely going by the search to term it's also trying to pick up the context in other words the meaning behind the search and it's able to provide you the results accordingly so to some in summary in the second search understood that the Apple that we referring to here is a fruit and the Apple that we referring to the in first search was the comp perfect so why is it getting popular now like what what is the need for like to now we know that due to the advancement in Internet there is an explosion of data and the explosion of data is in like very Diversified formats it's a text format it's an image format it's an audio format you could you there's multiple different types of formats the data is available today so what you need is a mechanism that can look into this data and it can get meaning out of this data classical databases where good at storing the structured data but they're not good in handling information like this so This presents a really good use case for Vector databases the second reason is large language models lack long-term memory so they're very good for shortterm conversations however anytime you want to store and retrieve uh some of the a long-term um information Vector database is going to be the key because Vector database helps you to store all the uh relevant information in one base and then that information can be available to the large language models during the query time or the inference time so the large language models can then use that information provide you better results so before we talk about vector database let talk about Vector embedding so what is a embedding you will hear this terminology pretty often in the large language model space but again anytime when somebody talks about embedding the only thing you need to remember is it's bunch of numbers it's a bunch of numbers but it means something so that bunch of numbers somehow captures the associations of your text and it stores that information within that bunch of numbers that's all you need to know and we will see how those numbers are are the the vectors are created in the next slides one other thing I want you to remember is in the vector space what happens is the data points that are closer in meaning are placed closer to each other whereas the vector points that are not so similar in meanings are placed far up so that way anytime you're trying to search for certain information a vector database is able to produce results that is closer to each other there are there are different types of vector embeddings a word can be a converted into an embedding a sentence could be converted into an embedding and then think about large documents um like a legal document marketing documents or legal contracts these are like multi-page documents and all of that information can be converted into into a into an embedding as well image can also be converted into embeddings as well so there are variety of techniques that is um that is provided here and um I will leave some documentation in the reference section for you to go and look into it how are vector embeddings created in the first place so Vector embeddings are created through a series of machion learning steps that includes um training the model as you can see here in the visual so the first step is to gather the data set and then you pre-process the data and once you pre-process the data what you do is you will train a machine learning model and the Machine learning model what it will do is it will try to pick up the signals the patterns um or the other representations in the data and then after it understood the representation it will generate embeddings so once those embeddings are generated then you can verify the model quality of what those how those embeddings are uh whether they are providing you good results if the model is not providing you good results then you go back and redo the same step so it's an iterative process you continue doing this over and over and over again until you are confident that the the model that you built is good enough for you to provide proper embeddings then you select the final model so that's the process series of steps that uh that that has been done you can go to hugging face today and just download a pre-train model from there and then you can use that for um creating Vector embeddings for your projects in fact that's what we will do in our lab in the next session so I wanted you to just understand how this whole pre-train models are created so that when we go in the next section and and use a pre-train model you will understand uh how those Vector embeddings are generated perfect now that we we have a good understanding of what an Vector embedding is now think about the scale or the amount of embeddings that you're going to generate in a project it could be millions and millions of data points so what you need is you need the ability to store that Vector information in a much more more optimized way and not only storage but you need to also think about how you can retrieve that information in an optimized way as well so that is where Vector database shines because Vector database indexes the data in a efficient way indexing is an extremely important Concept in Vector database um there are there are multiple ways you can index and Vector databases in the market today use different types of indexing um you can you can read through it I will give you I have provided a link in the reference section you can walk through it uh what are the different types of indexing that's available this is a good visual that was provided by the elastic search uh portal you could see here from left to right what happens is your data type could be an image document audio doesn't matter then what you do is you take this information and then you pass this through a pre-trained model that uh we spoke about in the previous slide and that pre-trained model will provide a vector embedding and now think about the scale or the amount of vector embeddings that you're going to generate because there are like let's assume you have millions of documents so now you need to P you need to Index this information and store it efficiently in a vector database so for that the vector database will store the information in optimized way and now let's say the end there's there's a query that's coming from an end user who wants to search for a for for a term and that term would be converted Again by the by the tree train model as a as a vector and that Vector would be sent into the vector database and the vector database will try and find a similar matching response to the received Vector data and it will provide the results that end results would be semantically closer to meaning because your vector database what it does is it it searches based on the um similari similarity scores so there are multiple similarity scores we will again see that in the uh in the indexing section in the lab so there is cosine similarity there is a DOT product there is ukan distance um so you can you can configure that when you're creating a database but the takeaway here is what you need to remember is a vector data datase offers a way to store vast amount of data in optimized way and it it also provides the ability to search our ability to retrieve the information faster that in terms of applications what it's going to give you is provide the ability to remember your past data and that information can be passed back to the large language models U during the inference time so it helps the mission learning models remember the past data and it also very helpful for semantic search personalized recommendation and text generation as well so in the next session I will walk you through a lab and we will set up a semantic search engine using elastic search end to end and you will see all of the concepts that we discussed here will be put into action so at that point you will understand the end to endend uh workflow of a vector database I hope you found this session helpful thank you so much for joining happy learning\",\n",

intuition behind them before we get to the intuition behind the vector database let's look at the pop let's look at a popular use case semantic search and let's see how someone like Google uses this effectively so if you go to Google and let's say you search how many employees does Apple have the moment you search for this Google understands that you're talking about the company Apple so it ranks its results based on that information that it found about your query similarly if you search for a another term let's say where can I pick apples near me in this context Google understood that the

       "  'text': \"welcome back to the course in this section what we will do is we will build a semantic search engine using elastic search in order to do that we would use the same python environment that you have set up in module one so I would like to use the same environment and also let's use the same Docker container that was used in the previous modules as well so I'm going to go and check if my Docker is currently running so Docker PS I don't have any Docker running right now so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to our Zoom Camp module one I'm just going to share the screen here you could see it on your screen from unit one me scroll up you could see from unit unit one introduction section there was a Docker command that was provided right here I'm going to copy that command and put it back here and enter let's give it a few seconds and you should see the docker container up and running and what this will help us to do is to connect to the elastic search locally you can see on the screen now the docker container is up and running so when we initiate a connection in the notebook shortly we should be able to you know get the client connected all right so let's go back open up vs code in your local and navigate to the same virtual environment or navigate to the same environment where you used uh which you used for module one so I'm using the same environment here the only difference is I installed one additional package which I will talk about other than that everything else should be the same so what you see here is the overall architecture to build our semantic search in for this module what we're going to do is we're going to use the same documents. Json file which you should be familiar with which was used in the other modules as well we will use the same data set for this class as well so what you need to do is take the documents. Json file create what we call as do documents which you will see shortly what do we mean by that so you need to create something called documents don't confuse with this documents with the documents. Json though the names are same but this terminology is used in elastic search so we need to create from the data set we need to create what we call as documents so once the documents are created then what we will do is we will get a pre-trained model from hugging phas and then we will create create the embeddings for the documents that we creating and once we get the embeddings then we will push that embeddings into an index in the elastic search and once the embeddings are indexed into the elastic search then anytime a new anytime a user enters a new search query then what would that do is that will go into the embeddings again that's query will be converted as embeddings as well and then that would go and query the the elastic search Vector database and the results the semantic results will be displayed so that's the overall architecture so let's go ahead and get started a few Concepts to understand there are two important Concepts in elastic search Vector database one is called documents and other one is index so as you can see here a document is a collection of fields with your Associated values so you will see what do we mean by that so what do we mean by the associated values and then what you will have to do is you need to take those documents right and you need to add all your documents to an index so that's what this architecture exactly talks about you need to take those documents and add it in index however there's one step in between where we'll create embeddings but the idea is you take the document and push it into index and what is an index index is a collection of documents that is stored in a highly optimized format designed to perform efficient searches right think about it why the index is going to be the key index is like exactly like a table of contents in a book so anytime you read a book you go through the table of contents and that will help you to do is it will help you to go to the to the right section pretty fast so you don't have to go through the entire book you just need to go through the table of contents to go to the right portion of right portion of the book so that's exactly how indexing works here so we will see that in action I will I will show you how that that's going to work so let's start preparing the data set first so in order for us to get started what we're going to do is we what we doing is we're opening up document. Json file and reading the file so that after that what you're going to do is if you look at the documents uncore ra what you will notice is you can see here the course and the documents there are two levels of hierarchy right now however what elastic search wants is to have a everything in like a same same level same hierarchy so instead of having course on the top and then documents on the bottom if you want everything to be in like in the same level so in order to do that we have to write a simple for loop again and loop through the docs uncore raw and then basically reassign it so let's look at the values after this step is done all right perfect so now you can see the course and the the questions and all answers in that section everything is in the same level so this is good so this is exactly what we wanted all right so let's move on to step two so in step two what we going to do is you're going to initiate a package called sentence Transformers we're going to import this package recall I have already installed this package but I'm leaving the the package uh information here so just make sure to run this command and uh once you run run this command and then try to import this package I've seen some some issues not in this environment but based on my experience I've noticed some issues happening especially because of the latest numpy edition if that happens just follow these steps if you're not able to import after you install the sentence Transformer all you need to do is UN install napai and then follow these steps you should be able to import your sentence Transformer so what is a sentence Transformer why is it required so let's go back to the documentation so I'm going to bring the sentence Transformer documentation here and then let's go to and you could see here the sentence Transformer sentence transform was created by ukp lab and is currently being maintained by hugging phase so what this will help you is this will help you with a very simple um call from the sentence Transformer package you can call the pre-trained models in just one line of code and you can call the required pre-trained models and then you can also perform inferencing in in another one line of code so it makes the whole process very simple so you you can see what are the pre-trained models that's available within this particular um library and you have to just scroll down here you could see that um there are there are variety of pre-trained models that's available again what is this pre-trained model these are the models that has already been trained on a certain data set and it's it's available for you to start you know creating embeddings so anytime you pass a data into this particular model what you're going to get out is a is a dense numeric Vector so with that Vector we're going to pass that Vector into our Vector database so that's what we going to do so you could see you can see all the performance benchmarks here you can click on any of these um models and you get to see all the required information here so let's go now let's we're going to use all mpet based V2 in our case so let's use the same um let's just copy the code from here and let's go to the cell here then just place it here and then it's executed so this step is now complete now let's go and try to perform a very simple inference and you could see this is a simple sentence and what you would get back is a dense Vector you see here you what you get back is a vector that's it perfect so the idea is anytime you pass a certain text any to this model you're going to get back a vector and you could see the length of the vector this length is important because different models have different lengths all right so now that is done what we will do is we will set up the now before doing that let's go ahead and create the embeddings remember the whole idea why we downloaded this model is because we wanted to create embeddings for our data set all right so before that let's go ahead and take a look at the data set once so in this data set you could see there are four different fields the first field the first and the Third Field are the actual data the section and the course field are like categorical data so there is not a lot of information um or variation that's going to exist in the data set so it makes sense to either create embeddings on the Tex field or on the question field so for our exercise purposes I I chose to do embeddings on the next field in order for you to do that what you need to do is you can um create a simple for Loop and you just Loop through the documents and for every document what you need to do is you need to um put the you need to call the model ncode function and then store the um Vector back into a another another field so we'll see that it's a very simple uh for Loop I'm just going to put it out here so go right here so as I said you just need to Loop through the documents and after you're looping through what you're doing is you are calling the model. encode on the dock of text field and then you assigning it back into the same um list um with a different name called textor Vector so that's pretty much it so let's just start doing this might take a few minutes so let's resume after this um step is complete all right now the step is complete and the embeddings are created so let's go back and verify I think it's in the operations right it's going to operations looks like yes so we have created the embeddings nothing but a dense vector and added this back to this documents perfect looks very good so now what we will do is let's initiate the elastic search connection remember we have already ran the doc container so locally so we should not have any issues perfect so I could see that the connection is established here then what we're going to do is let's as a next step we need to create what we call as mappings so now that the elastic search CLI is created the next step is we need to create an index so in order for us to create an index you need to First create a mapping so think about this from a from a database standpoint whenever you're creating a schema so what you need to provide is for the schema you need to provide the column names the table name and then what the data types are right so you need to provide that metadata in order for you to create a schema very similarly in this case you need to provide what we call as mapping and that mapping will contain all the required metadata information about your uh about the document data so that's exactly what it's mentioned here you can read through it but you could the first line just calls out the exact statement I just said is the process of defining how a document and the fields it contains a stored and index that's it so you should be very familiar with the mapping already because um it's the same almost the same information that I'm copying and pasting it from module one and you could see that uh for the mappings here in the property section you could see there are different fields these fields should be the same fields that we created here fix section question right so these are all the same fields and you could see the data types associated with it the only difference is what we have done today is we have created something called a text Vector which is nothing but a dense vector and uh we need to also specify the dimensions here so remember the dimensions we got it from our inference initially just go back a step here just want to show you real quick so that's the dimensions it is also mentioned on the model uh sentence Transformer documentation for every models as well and then you need to also specify the similarity metric in which in which your the text Vector should be stored um in the in the vector database so there are several metrics that's available so it could be cosine Matrix it could be n to Norm dot product ukian distance um I'm I'm leaving I will leave you some reference uh in the in the references section so you can read through it but by far the most popular type is the is the cosine or a DOT prodct all right so that's pretty much it so let's just run this so now let's go ahead and uh create the index so you could see here the bottom line here so this is how you create the index so you need to specify IND isis. create provide the index name that you have defined here and also pass all the required metadata that we have created here and what I'm doing here on the top is I'm creating something called a delete indexes statement that's because what I've noticed is when you're working through this data set or when you're working on this project you might realize that you you updated the data set or you wanted to change the data type in scenarios like those you go and update the mapping but when you try to create the index with the same name you will get an error so in order for you to avoid that what you can do is as a best practice every time you can just delete the index uh if it exists and if it doesn't exist you can ignore this delete statement so that's all this this line is doing here so now let's go and create the index fantastic that step is done so now the index is created we already have the embeddings created in the document so now what you need to do is you need to populate those embeddings or the whole document into the index so that's what we're going to do here for that we need to just Loop through the operations data set that we have prepared and um what we need to do is for every document you need to push that document into the indexes into the index that's that's what the statement is is doing it might take about a minute or two so let's resume after this statement is complete or this execution is complete this step is now complete so let's go back and take a look at the architecture to see where we are so we have pretty much completed the first portion of our architecture so we took the documents. Json file we created documents out of it and then we took a pre-trained model and in that pre-trained model we passed the documents to create embeddings and once that embeddings are created then we pushed it into the elastic searches index and so with all of the the blue all of the black lines are complete now so now let's go and build the new search query so that's the search term that a end user um wants to query the data on and what we will do is we will pass that to the embeddings as well and then look at the results all right so for that let's go to this section let's create a search term here so the search term the end user wants to search for is Windows or Mac so the user wants to know for the course should they bring a Windows laptop or a Mac laptop or a Windows Os or a Mac OS and remember every term um that the search term that the user is is searching has to be converted it into in into a vector as well so that's what this line is doing and once that step is done let's go and run this now we have to form this query so you could see here so we're building a query and in the query what we what we specifying is in the database which field should the should the database go and search for and what is the the vector that the user is is searching so the user is searching Windows or Mac so and that is converted into a vector and that is that is what this query _ Vector is taking as input and then K5 meaning you want to provide five nearest uh neighbors or five nearest documents uh that matches to this particular search term and number of candidates it's nothing but if you can think about this like a group of documents that um the search is going to look into and you can play around with this number um like 1,000 2,000 and then you can play which whatever works for you and that's pretty much it so now what we are going to do is we are going to pass this to elastic searches search functionality a search method so you could see here there is a search method and it takes the index name and then it takes the query that we have built here in this previous step and then in the results you're specifying what are the fields that you want in the results pack so what I'm going to do is I'm going to just uh in the response that we're going to get I know that the response is uh is mentioned in this particular um field so let's go and run this Fant fantastic so let's open up the results in the text editor so the first thing what I wanted to show you the mention is you could see you remember we mentioned ks5 so you should see one two 3 four five so Five results so you got back Five results and then you could see for every result there is a score so the score the the results are ranked um by the highest score on the top and the and then and then the lowest score on the bottom and the score of anytime a score is close to one it indicates that it's a very good match and anytime a score is close to zero it denotes it's a very bad match so we got a score of 71 which is a pretty decent score so let's go and look at the look at the text on what what did what what did we see here so remember what the inducer search for the inducer was searching for yeah Windows or Mac right and the first result you got back is yes Linux is ideal but technically it should not matter so now think about it right nowhere in the query the end user mentioned whether this is an operating system or a laptop they just mentioned Windows or Mac however this semantic search was smart enough to understand the semantics meaning the the the underlying meanings associated with the end user search so he understood that it's talking about the operating system so it went and searched for the the closest match that that um matches with the operating system and it gave you this this information so you can you can now see the power that uh that that that you can uncover in scenarios like this because this is exactly how your Google search works so recall the in the first introduction section in in this module we talked about how Apple how the Google is ranking based on whether if apple is a flute your search results will vary and if apple is a company your search results will vary so that's exactly how semantic search works behind the scenes so congratulations you built a semantic search in this section um I also wanted to call out that uh this is just a very simple semantic search we built there are much much more complex um semantic searches you can build and I also want to show you one L little bit of um combination of um couple of um queries here so what you can also do is anytime when the IND user is searching you can use um your regular um query search on top of it you can also make sure that the results can be should be filtered from only one course remember there are this data set has information from three courses but what if you want to only look at one course because let's assume that this user is asking this question in the data engineering Zoom Camp course so you want the results only from this course so you can basically chain your Search terms accordingly and then you can filter them you can you can query them um based on um different combinations that is very powerful for for semantic search let's run this results let's look at the result set perfect so you could see now that the result is only coming from the data engineering Zoom Camp so that's good congratulations you built a semantic search engine using elastic search Vector database I hope you enjoyed the session thank you so much for joining happy

       "  'text_vector': \"LLM Zoomcamp 3.2 - Semantic Search with Elasticsearc welcome back to the course in this section what we will do is we will build a semantic search engine using elastic search in order to do that we would use the same python environment that you have set up in module one so I would like to use the same environment and also let's use the same Docker container that was used in the previous modules as well so I'm going to go and check if my Docker is currently running so Docker PS I don't have any Docker running right now so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to our Zoom Camp module one I'm just going to share the screen here you could see it on your screen from unit one me scroll up you could see from unit unit one introduction section there was a Docker command that was provided right here I'm going to copy that command and put it back here and enter let's give it a few seconds and you should see the docker container up and running and what this will help us to do is to connect to the elastic search locally you can see on the screen now the docker container is up and running so when we initiate a connection in the notebook shortly we should be able to you know get the client connected all right so let's go back open up vs code in your local and navigate to the same virtual environment or navigate to the same environment where you used uh which you used for module one so I'm using the same environment here the only difference is I installed one additional package which I will talk about other than that everything else should be the same so what you see here is the overall architecture to build our semantic search in for this module what we're going to do is we're going to use the same documents. Json file which you should be familiar with which was used in the other modules as well we will use the same data set for this class as well so what you need to do is take the documents. Json file create what we call as do documents which you will see shortly what do we mean by that so you need to create something called documents don't confuse with this documents with the documents. Json though the names are same but this terminology is used in elastic search so we need to create from the data set we need to create what we call as documents so once the documents are created then what we will do is we will get a pre-trained model from hugging phas and then we will create create the embeddings for the documents that we creating and once we get the embeddings then we will push that embeddings into an index in the elastic search and once the embeddings are indexed into the elastic search then anytime a new anytime a user enters a new search query then what would that do is that will go into the embeddings again that's query will be converted as embeddings as well and then that would go and query the the elastic search Vector database and the results the semantic results will be displayed so that's the overall architecture so let's go ahead and get started a few Concepts to understand there are two important Concepts in elastic search Vector database one is called documents and other one is index so as you can see here a document is a collection of fields with your Associated values so you will see what do we mean by that so what do we mean by the associated values and then what you will have to do is you need to take those documents right and you need to add all your documents to an index so that's what this architecture exactly talks about you need to take those documents and add it in index however there's one step in between where we'll create embeddings but the idea is you take the document and push it into index and what is an index index is a collection of documents that is stored in a highly optimized format designed to perform efficient searches right think about it why the index is going to be the key index is like exactly like a table of contents in a book so anytime you read a book you go through the table of contents and that will help you to do is it will help you to go to the to the right section pretty fast so you don't have to go through the entire book you just need to go through the table of contents to go to the right portion of right portion of the book so that's exactly how indexing works here so we will see that in action I will I will show you how that that's going to work so let's start preparing the data set first so in order for us to get started what we're going to do is we what we doing is we're opening up document. Json file and reading the file so that after that what you're going to do is if you look at the documents uncore ra what you will notice is you can see here the course and the documents there are two levels of hierarchy right now however what elastic search wants is to have a everything in like a same same level same hierarchy so instead of having course on the top and then documents on the bottom if you want everything to be in like in the same level so in order to do that we have to write a simple for loop again and loop through the docs uncore raw and then basically reassign it so let's look at the values after this step is done all right perfect so now you can see the course and the the questions and all answers in that section everything is in the same level so this is good so this is exactly what we wanted all right so let's move on to step two so in step two what we going to do is you're going to initiate a package called sentence Transformers we're going to import this package recall I have already installed this package but I'm leaving the the package uh information here so just make sure to run this command and uh once you run run this command and then try to import this package I've seen some some issues not in this environment but based on my experience I've noticed some issues happening especially because of the latest numpy edition if that happens just follow these steps if you're not able to import after you install the sentence Transformer all you need to do is UN install napai and then follow these steps you should be able to import your sentence Transformer so what is a sentence Transformer why is it required so let's go back to the documentation so I'm going to bring the sentence Transformer documentation here and then let's go to and you could see here the sentence Transformer sentence transform was created by ukp lab and is currently being maintained by hugging phase so what this will help you is this will help you with a very simple um call from the sentence Transformer package you can call the pre-trained models in just one line of code and you can call the required pre-trained models and then you can also perform inferencing in in another one line of code so it makes the whole process very simple so you you can see what are the pre-trained models that's available within this particular um library and you have to just scroll down here you could see that um there are there are variety of pre-trained models that's available again what is this pre-trained model these are the models that has already been trained on a certain data set and it's it's available for you to start you know creating embeddings so anytime you pass a data into this particular model what you're going to get out is a is a dense numeric Vector so with that Vector we're going to pass that Vector into our Vector database so that's what we going to do so you could see you can see all the performance benchmarks here you can click on any of these um models and you get to see all the required information here so let's go now let's we're going to use all mpet based V2 in our case so let's use the same um let's just copy the code from here and let's go to the cell here then just place it here and then it's executed so this step is now complete now let's go and try to perform a very simple inference and you could see this is a simple sentence and what you would get back is a dense Vector you see here you what you get back is a vector that's it perfect so the idea is anytime you pass a certain text any to this model you're going to get back a vector and you could see the length of the vector this length is important because different models have different lengths all right so now that is done what we will do is we will set up the now before doing that let's go ahead and create the embeddings remember the whole idea why we downloaded this model is because we wanted to create embeddings for our data set all right so before that let's go ahead and take a look at the data set once so in this data set you could see there are four different fields the first field the first and the Third Field are the actual data the section and the course field are like categorical data so there is not a lot of information um or variation that's going to exist in the data set so it makes sense to either create embeddings on the Tex field or on the question field so for our exercise purposes I I chose to do embeddings on the next field in order for you to do that what you need to do is you can um create a simple for Loop and you just Loop through the documents and for every document what you need to do is you need to um put the you need to call the model ncode function and then store the um Vector back into a another another field so we'll see that it's a very simple uh for Loop I'm just going to put it out here so go right here so as I said you just need to Loop through the documents and after you're looping through what you're doing is you are calling the model. encode on the dock of text field and then you assigning it back into the same um list um with a different name called textor Vector so that's pretty much it so let's just start doing this might take a few minutes so let's resume after this um step is complete all right now the step is complete and the embeddings are created so let's go back and verify I think it's in the operations right it's going to operations looks like yes so we have created the embeddings nothing but a dense vector and added this back to this documents perfect looks very good so now what we will do is let's initiate the elastic search connection remember we have already ran the doc container so locally so we should not have any issues perfect so I could see that the connection is established here then what we're going to do is let's as a next step we need to create what we call as mappings so now that the elastic search CLI is created the next step is we need to create an index so in order for us to create an index you need to First create a mapping so think about this from a from a database standpoint whenever you're creating a schema so what you need to provide is for the schema you need to provide the column names the table name and then what the data types are right so you need to provide that metadata in order for you to create a schema very similarly in this case you need to provide what we call as mapping and that mapping will contain all the required metadata information about your uh about the document data so that's exactly what it's mentioned here you can read through it but you could the first line just calls out the exact statement I just said is the process of defining how a document and the fields it contains a stored and index that's it so you should be very familiar with the mapping already because um it's the same almost the same information that I'm copying and pasting it from module one and you could see that uh for the mappings here in the property section you could see there are different fields these fields should be the same fields that we created here fix section question right so these are all the same fields and you could see the data types associated with it the only difference is what we have done today is we have created something called a text Vector which is nothing but a dense vector and uh we need to also specify the dimensions here so remember the dimensions we got it from our inference initially just go back a step here just want to show you real quick so that's the dimensions it is also mentioned on the model uh sentence Transformer documentation for every models as well and then you need to also specify the similarity metric in which in which your the text Vector should be stored um in the in the vector database so there are several metrics that's available so it could be cosine Matrix it could be n to Norm dot product ukian distance um I'm I'm leaving I will leave you some reference uh in the in the references section so you can read through it but by far the most popular type is the is the cosine or a DOT prodct all right so that's pretty much it so let's just run this so now let's go ahead and uh create the index so you could see here the bottom line here so this is how you create the index so you need to specify IND isis. create provide the index name that you have defined here and also pass all the required metadata that we have created here and what I'm doing here on the top is I'm creating something called a delete indexes statement that's because what I've noticed is when you're working through this data set or when you're working on this project you might realize that you you updated the data set or you wanted to change the data type in scenarios like those you go and update the mapping but when you try to create the index with the same name you will get an error so in order for you to avoid that what you can do is as a best practice every time you can just delete the index uh if it exists and if it doesn't exist you can ignore this delete statement so that's all this this line is doing here so now let's go and create the index fantastic that step is done so now the index is created we already have the embeddings created in the document so now what you need to do is you need to populate those embeddings or the whole document into the index so that's what we're going to do here for that we need to just Loop through the operations data set that we have prepared and um what we need to do is for every document you need to push that document into the indexes into the index that's that's what the statement is is doing it might take about a minute or two so let's resume after this statement is complete or this execution is complete this step is now complete so let's go back and take a look at the architecture to see where we are so we have pretty much completed the first portion of our architecture so we took the documents. Json file we created documents out of it and then we took a pre-trained model and in that pre-trained model we passed the documents to create embeddings and once that embeddings are created then we pushed it into the elastic searches index and so with all of the the blue all of the black lines are complete now so now let's go and build the new search query so that's the search term that a end user um wants to query the data on and what we will do is we will pass that to the embeddings as well and then look at the results all right so for that let's go to this section let's create a search term here so the search term the end user wants to search for is Windows or Mac so the user wants to know for the course should they bring a Windows laptop or a Mac laptop or a Windows Os or a Mac OS and remember every term um that the search term that the user is is searching has to be converted it into in into a vector as well so that's what this line is doing and once that step is done let's go and run this now we have to form this query so you could see here so we're building a query and in the query what we what we specifying is in the database which field should the should the database go and search for and what is the the vector that the user is is searching so the user is searching Windows or Mac so and that is converted into a vector and that is that is what this query _ Vector is taking as input and then K5 meaning you want to provide five nearest uh neighbors or five nearest documents uh that matches to this particular search term and number of candidates it's nothing but if you can think about this like a group of documents that um the search is going to look into and you can play around with this number um like 1,000 2,000 and then you can play which whatever works for you and that's pretty much it so now what we are going to do is we are going to pass this to elastic searches search functionality a search method so you could see here there is a search method and it takes the index name and then it takes the query that we have built here in this previous step and then in the results you're specifying what are the fields that you want in the results pack so what I'm going to do is I'm going to just uh in the response that we're going to get I know that the response is uh is mentioned in this particular um field so let's go and run this Fant fantastic so let's open up the results in the text editor so the first thing what I wanted to show you the mention is you could see you remember we mentioned ks5 so you should see one two 3 four five so Five results so you got back Five results and then you could see for every result there is a score so the score the the results are ranked um by the highest score on the top and the and then and then the lowest score on the bottom and the score of anytime a score is close to one it indicates that it's a very good match and anytime a score is close to zero it denotes it's a very bad match so we got a score of 71 which is a pretty decent score so let's go and look at the look at the text on what what did what what did we see here so remember what the inducer search for the inducer was searching for yeah Windows or Mac right and the first result you got back is yes Linux is ideal but technically it should not matter so now think about it right nowhere in the query the end user mentioned whether this is an operating system or a laptop they just mentioned Windows or Mac however this semantic search was smart enough to understand the semantics meaning the the the underlying meanings associated with the end user search so he understood that it's talking about the operating system so it went and searched for the the closest match that that um matches with the operating system and it gave you this this information so you can you can now see the power that uh that that that you can uncover in scenarios like this because this is exactly how your Google search works so recall the in the first introduction section in in this module we talked about how Apple how the Google is ranking based on whether if apple is a flute your search results will vary and if apple is a company your search results will vary so that's exactly how semantic search works behind the scenes so congratulations you built a semantic search in this section um I also wanted to call out that uh this is just a very simple semantic search we built there are much much more complex um semantic searches you can build and I also want to show you one L little bit of um combination of um couple of um queries here so what you can also do is anytime when the IND user is searching you can use um your regular um query search on top of it you can also make sure that the results can be should be filtered from only one course remember there are this data set has information from three courses but what if you want to only look at one course because let's assume that this user is asking this question in the data engineering Zoom Camp course so you want the results only from this course so you can basically chain your Search terms accordingly and then you can filter them you can you can query them um based on um different combinations that is very powerful for for semantic search let's run this results let's look at the result set perfect so you could see now that the result is only coming from the data engineering Zoom Camp so that's good congratulations you built a semantic search engine using elastic search Vector database I hope you enjoyed the session thank you so much for joining happy learning

quickly check if it actually works ground truth zero so something is wrong okay so uh yeah of course this is our query Yeah question so this still stays question and our uh Vector is still question because this is the question from the student this is not the question from our database and I got a bit confused because of that but here we use text Vector did we use text Vector previously so previously it was question Vector here we use text Vector right so actually the rest stays the same because the question from the student is still the question from the student we just use a different um field inside elastic too much uh to against uh to compute the similarity against this uh Vector right uh okay so I think uh this works now and I will also execute this and I think the speed is um well it shouldn't be different because like the dimensionality of factors uh is the same okay so while it's evaluating I will also do the other thing so we have text Vector we have question vector and then we have question text Vector right uh which would be question text Vector if I remember correctly um where do we have it question text Vector yes so this one and this is something I will execute to right now okay so again putting this on pause and then coming back when when both of them finish and I hope this one does not have any errors any mistakes so it will just run okay so in the first part computed it took quite some time but as we see uh if we just use the text Vector the uh it improved even more than uh just using question and now we see combined and in the meantime what I wanted to check is uh I think there is a way in elastic search to combine like we did with text so with text we computed uh both um um so we have our query and then we executed it against both um do I have it here an example so when we did it in the first module our yeah so our query was multimatch and it was multimatch with text uh I think there is a way to do the same with uh KNN and this is something uh we can ask chat GPD uh hey I have um I'll just put it on pause finish typing and then you'll see the my prompt so this is what I typed I have an elastics search index with three dense vectors uh I want to quy all three of them with one vector all of them were created using the same embedding model so we can compare them so I want to have something similar to this and but with Canon and this is my current Canon quer so let's see uh what it wrote okay interesting so actually what we can do is uh use a script here to compute cign similarity between all these three I had no idea um but let us check it uh while this is uh this is being computed um so I hope it works CU I have never used it uh so is it um elastic search can is it similar to this one yes so have field Vector but we will just have one vector right uh combined and uh yeah I want to see this for qn and what we have of course let's say data engineering Zoom Camp so it still needs to finish uh um evaluating the results no it's not so long yeah I'll just put it on B yeah so the result is even better when we combine them it's 91 so I imagine if we used a better model from um where is it if we used this one it would be even better right which is quite good where is it it's quite good so heat rate and Mr are good and let us see if this one actually works Q is not defined and how did we call it I don't remember inq yeah okay so it doesn't seem to work well I will not attempt to spend uh I will not spend time right now cuz uh this is something new sometimes things coming from jgpt they don't necessarily work um you can experiment with that I'll also experiment with that uh after this video and maybe I'll share the results with you I will commit this notebook as this with a note that note this doesn't work and then feel free to play with this maybe you know elastic search better than me uh and uh if you know elastic search better than me uh maybe you know how to actually do this in the right way and if that's if this is the case please let us know share this in chat and anyways we can see that uh this is clearly better even though it is uh slower but sometimes being slower is okay and we can do 17 iterations per second so per one student they will probably not even notice that there is uh uh it's slower than what we had before right okay so this is how we evaluate different methods and here we compare text uh evaluation of text results with evaluation of vector uh search we can see that in this data set Vector search worked better one of the reasons for that could be in the way we constructed the data we asked GPT to specifically include as fewer words as possible from the original FAQ record so it kind of makes sense and we see that in these situations Vector search makes sense okay so that's all for this section I hope you enjoyed it and see you around so five or six hours later I actually read what charp road saying make sure to adjust Vector one vector 2 and Vector 3 to the actual field names because obviously for some reasons it cannot read my mind so what I will do is I will actually replace it so we have text vector and then question text Vector right so I replace that now execute and then it complains that for some document it returned an invalid score which is weird like it shouldn't happen so I don't know how it's possible but whatever what we can do is just add one to make sure it always stays positive and then we get the results right and we can now evaluate this result too so I'll do it um yeah so what we need is um um I guess these two I'll combine them into one one cell and now copy it so this uh I'll call it vectors combined K andn and we here use this elastic search K and then combined K and then combined and we only need to pass the vector oops too much the vector and course and yeah let's remove that and execute that I think it's is it slightly slower yeah a little bit right so now H I guess for elastic it's more difficult to compute this similarity I actually have no idea how this works so I have some ideas how it works when it comes to individual uh one so for this one yeah I don't know uh but yeah we can see that it's only slightly slower well actually not slightly but 30 maybe even 40% slower or if not if not 50 but anyways actually like it's still 15 iterations per second so for a user uh probably they will not notice anything uh but of course when we evaluate across the entire data set it's not as well so I'll put it on pause again and come back when it finishes and I'm really curious what kind of score we will have does it make sense to actually do that cuz it makes it more complex so now we will see okay so it finished heat rate 90% Mr 80% let's compare it with the previous one yeah it's actually worse so like making it more complicated does not necessarily mean it's becoming better so as we see the best option and it's also like a bit faster to just use use the question text and Vector text combined so I guess this is what we should use and now thanks to this ground proof data set that we have we can answer questions like that so that's all for this series and see you soon\",\n",

       "  'text': \"hi everyone and welcome back to the L&M Zoom Camp so this week it will be all about monitoring so we're now in the fourth module and by now youve learned about the okay the overall concepts of rack systems like how you can retrieve augment and generate an llm answer so you've not only learned to Ping open AI endpoint to to to for instance a GPT model but also we've covered um how to self-host a model with ol Lama for instance and then okay how do we actually add domain data or context data to this llm system by using Vector databases so it means you're storing data into a vector store you retrieving and then Alexa also has um covered how do you actually compute or or assess if the vector retrieval was good enough and then for today we want to observe and monitor if the answer of the llm and the quality is good enough and there are different ways to do this so this is what we will cover in today's um video so today's video will just be like 10 to 15 minutes theoretical and then in the upcoming videos we will really dive into the code but for today we're just going to do an extended introduction like what are the topics that we are going to cover and the concepts behind monitoring llm systems first of all why monitoring L llm systems it might be that we don't need to convince anyone but um there are I think also like maybe maybe people in your company that they are saying like hey you know I'm just trusting the system I'm deploying it and then it's I'm done but actually it's not enough to just build a system and deploy the llm system but in the end you also have to monitor it over time when you operate system so that you know how is my llm doing so that's what we're going to discuss then also okay how do I now actually monitor the quality of my llms so how do I know if the answer that my llm is giving is is good enough towards the user so we can compute different types of quality metrix store the computed metrix in a relational database and then use grafana to visualize the metrics over time so that we can really keep track of the information of the important information and metrics over time then the other main part of the monitoring module will be okay how can I also use user feedback so how can I store the chat sessions and then also collect user feedback in a database and then I can connect this database again to crana and visualize the user feedback and the corresponding chat sessions over time this module is meant to be be extending over the course of one week so we won't be able to cover everything and also what I'll be sharing here is definitely it's not everything for the perfect monitoring systems it's just some starting starting points that you can take to your company or to your private project and start monitoring your system but there will also be things that we are not going to be able to cover as part of monitoring module so let's dive into the slide deag why do we need to monitor llm systems I think um it's it's pretty obvious like everyone thinks that llm systems are super super smart and intelligent and we don't need to do anything about it but then I think people also realize that okay actually we need to watch over these systems and it's super hard to watch over these systems because it's not just like an if else rule it's not just a hardcoded rule engine and and Rule based system but instead it's an llm it's an it's an llm system that is intelligent that generates answers that are different from each other the system can be sort of creative and come up with their own answer and and most importantly it really just answers in a way based on the data that is that it has been feed to so here is one example I think it's super famous it's even from 2016 like we don't even need to to call out any like recent misbehavior for any chatbot system but instead we can just remember the classical things where the where one AI chatbot was racist after I think a couple of days I think it didn't take long after this chatbot went bad and as a company you just want to Simply avoid to to yeah to disappoint your customers you don't want to be in the press and be famous for for your chatbot not behaving so that's why you want to monitor it and know what's going on over time as we said it's not enough to just deploy it and then hope for the best but better have an eye on the system one way of monitoring is to really monitor and observe the answer quality of the llm so how do I actually know that my llm system gave a good answer so there are different types of metrics that you can compute there's not this one single metric that you can compute and then you know everything about your your rag or llm system but instead you will have to come up with a set of feature H with a set of metrics that is going to tell you if your model is doing good or if you want to readjust and refine it so I I brought these three example metrics and these three are also the ones that we will then actually compute in Python code and and work with so I've chosen a very classical Vector similarity metric so what you're doing is you're just you're collector collecting a data set with crown roof so this is like the expected answer so you have a data set where you have your question the expected answer and then you add the llm generated answer to it and both of these texts you're going to just St as a vector embedding and then once you have it as a vector embedding you can just simply compute the vector similarity so that you know the mathematical distance between those two things so you know okay how how far is the generated answer from the expected answer so that also already gives you a clue of if it might make sense or if your llm system is completely off with with the generating the answer so that's a yeah a pure mathematical approach so there's no much room for for creativity it's just yeah Computing the vector similarity but then there are also um some more advanced ways of of estimating if if the answer is good enough of your system so you can actually use llms as a judge so finnally you could just use an llm that is like focused on for instance detecting toxicity within a text and then you can just ask the llm like hey do you think that this llm answer that my other llm generated is toxic or not and you can get a score for it so there are are for instance open source models on hugging phas available that that just focus on okay assessing if a text is toxic or not so this is what we're also going to do and compute we will be downloading a model from hugging phase and then prepare a prompt to ask the llm to judge about the toxicity of our other lm's answer and then as a third metric what we're going to compute is to really ask the llm like we're going to write a prompt where we ask the llm like look this is the llm answer that I received from another llm system and this is the expected answer and then we just asked LM do you think this makes sense or not so this is definitely a more creative way of of judging if the answer is good enough so I would say it can detect more complex patterns but it might also go um be like too creative and then that's where we that's why we also want to have the combination with the mathematical approach and then then those three metrics as I set are already a good starting point and then you as a company or with your pet project at home can just assess which metrics do you need and do you want to extend it with further metrics then we're going to store the computed metrics in a relational database we're going to use postr SQL for it we will boot it up inside of a Docker container and then also have a Docker compos file so that we can combine all the services and easily connect the database to crana and then on crana we going to to add some graphics so that we can simply visualize the metrix over time next one we also want to give our beloved users the chance to give feedback so you might know it from tat front and there you're also able to give a thumbs up or a coms down and that's what we also want to this concept is what we also want to do with our Rack or llm system so we want to collect the user feedback thumbs up and thumbs down in a database and alongside this we also want to start the chat sessions because obviously then we want to know okay if there's like a lot of negative feedback we want to know okay about which chat session was it and what did the what did the customer or user actually ask and what does the system answer so that's why we also need to store the whole chat history so that we can trace it back and here again we will also use the open source visualization tool grafana put it up in a Docker container connected to the database where we have stored the user feedback in the chat sessions and then visualize the user feedback over time as I said in this one week we don't want to overwhelm you and we're also not experts in everything so that's why I've listed some further the things you might want to monitor that are not covered by this module obviously you can track and record further quality metrics and user feedback I have only proposed three different kind of metrics and storing the thumbs up and thumbs down button but you should do more you can and should do more so for instance you might want to know about buyers and fairness you want to know how how fair is your model towards different genders towards different nationalities and regions of the world then you might also want to know what is your customers talking about you might think that every customer just ask like hey what's the quickest way to buy your product but in fact they're just asking like how can I how can I get a refund how can I get a discount code right and then this is things that you could cover and observe with topic clustering that you just have like yeah clusters of topics where you know oh this is actually what my people are talking about with the llm system this is how they are really using it and you might not only want to have structured feedback with thumbs up or thumbs down but you could also have textual user feedback that they can really explain like hey this answer was not correct because of of course it's then more effort to analyze this feedback because it's unstructured text but for some situations if you for instance detect some chat sessions and messages where the feedback was very negative then you might want to dive into the corresponding textual user feedback and then for instance on cat GPT front L you also have the possibility to copy copy an answer or or the like the code of an answer and then that's also that could also be an indirect sign of the user likes what I'm proposing and now the user is going to to try it out that's why the user is copy pasting it so that's also a way of indirect feedback it might be worth monitoring then for all the devops engineers here you might have already heard about four golden signals so you not only want to know about the like quality of your llm model answer but you also want to know other so so-called system metrics of your system they are called latency traffic errors and saturation those four golden signals and latency is obviously you want to know if your customer is waiting like 10 seconds for an answer or or if the system is quick enough in answering you also want to know okay how many customers are actually using my chatbot how much traffic am I receiving and does my llm system respond with error codes or is everything fine because I mean I think everyone of you has seen this like 404 or or with ch GPT or other providers there's there are error messages like hey something went wrong and that's what the user is seeing on the UI and is is like sad or desperate about it so we as developers of an llm system also want to know if our customers are seeing a lot of errors or or everything is going smooth and it's also no surprise that these systems are very resource hungry so we want to know about the saturation how much memory and GPU is my system using so this is referred to as the four golden signal so hey if you have a daop engineer in your company just just grabbed them and ask him to to add those also um to your llm system so that you not only have the quality metrics and the user feedback but that you also compl it with system metrics another nons surprising fact is that llms are not that cheap so if you have the time you should also invest in really monitoring and tracking the cost of your used infrastructure so typically you would have a vector store and an llm IPI that you are calling the vector store itself like I found it's not that expensive but what's really expensive if you either use a managed API for instance with open AI or other model providers you have to buy tokens and you have to pay for it per use so that might get expensive pretty quick or even if you're self host and you're running the model on gpus 24/7 then this can also increase the costs of your of your cloud provider or wherever you're using the gpus from but yeah here we also we won't have the time in this week to cover everything but you can read up on this LinkedIn post about it so thanks for listening in the next couple of videos we will really dive into the code so here for monitoring the answer quality of llms with metrics and um with those three we will uh write the python code together and equip our system store the metrics in a pogress database and use grafana to visualize it so we will build the code together and I will share it with you then in the GitHub repository and same same for monitoring the user feedback we will prepare all the python code to to store the chat sessions and collect the user feedback in in also post CR and then create a cunner dashboard to visualize it over time so see you in the next video\",\n",

what you're doing is you're just you're collector collecting a data set with crown roof so this is like the expected answer so you have a data set where you have your question the expected answer and then you add the llm generated answer to it and both of these texts you're going to just St as a vector embedding and then once you have it as a vector embedding you can just simply compute the vector similarity so that you know the mathematical distance between those two things so you know okay how how far is the generated answer from the expected answer so that also already gives you a clue of if it might make sense or if your llm system is completely off with with the generating the answer so that's a yeah a pure mathematical approach so there's no much room for for creativity it's just yeah Computing the vector similarity but then there are also um some more advanced ways of of estimating if if the answer is good enough of your system so you can actually use llms as a judge so finnally you could just use an llm that is like focused on for instance detecting toxicity within a text and then you can just ask the llm like hey do you think that this llm answer that my other llm generated is toxic or not and you can get a score for it so there are are for instance open source models on hugging phas available that that just focus on okay assessing if a text is toxic or not so this is what we're also going to do and compute we will be downloading a model from hugging phase and then prepare a prompt to ask the llm to judge about the toxicity of our other lm's answer and then as a third metric what we're going to compute is to really ask the llm like we're going to write a prompt where we ask the llm like look this is the llm answer that I received from another llm system and this is the expected answer and then we just asked LM do you think this makes sense or not so this is definitely a more creative way of of judging if the answer is good enough so I would say it can detect more complex patterns but it might also go um be like too creative and then that's where we that's why we also want to have the combination with the mathematical approach and then then those three metrics as I set are already a good starting point and then you as a company or with your pet project at home can just assess which metrics do you need and do you want to extend it with further metrics then we're going to store the computed metrics in a relational database we're going to use postr SQL for it we will boot it up inside of a Docker container and then also have a Docker compos file so that we can combine all the services and easily connect the database to crana and then on crana we going to to add some graphics so that we can simply visualize the metrix over time next one we also want to give our beloved users the chance to give feedback so you might know it from tat front and there you're also able to give a thumbs up or a coms down and that's what we also want to this concept is what we also want to do with our Rack or llm system so we want to collect the user feedback thumbs up and thumbs down in a database and alongside this we also want to start the chat sessions because obviously then we want to know okay if there's like a lot of negative feedback we want to know okay about which chat session was it and what did the what did the customer or user actually ask and what does the system answer so that's why we also need to store the whole chat history so that we can trace it back and here again we will also use the open source visualization tool grafana put it up in a Docker container connected to the database where we have stored the user feedback in the chat sessions and then visualize the user feedback over time as I said in this one week we don't want to overwhelm you and we're also not experts in everything so that's why I've listed some further the things you might want to monitor that are not covered by this module obviously you can track and record further quality metrics and user feedback I have only proposed three different kind of metrics and storing the thumbs up and thumbs down button but you should do more you can and should do more so for instance you might want to know about buyers and fairness you want to know how how fair is your model towards different genders towards different nationalities and regions of the world then you might also want to know what is your customers talking about you might think that every customer just ask like hey what's the quickest way to buy your product but in fact they're just asking like how can I how can I get a refund how can I get a discount code right and then this is things that you could cover and observe with topic clustering that you just have like yeah clusters of topics where you know oh this is actually what my people are talking about with the llm system this is how they are really using it and you might not only want to have structured feedback with thumbs up or thumbs down but you could also have textual user feedback that they can really explain like hey this answer was not correct because of of course it's then more effort to analyze this feedback because it's unstructured text but for some situations if you for instance detect some chat sessions and messages where the feedback was very negative then you might want to dive into the corresponding textual user feedback and then for instance on cat GPT front L you also have the possibility to copy copy an answer or or the like the code of an answer and then that's also that could also be an indirect sign of the user likes what I'm proposing and now the user is going to to try it out that's why the user is copy pasting it so that's also a way of indirect feedback it might be worth monitoring then for all the devops engineers here you might have already heard about four golden signals so you not only want to know about the like quality of your llm model answer but you also want to know other so so-called system metrics of your system they are called latency traffic errors and saturation those four golden signals and latency is obviously you want to know if your customer is waiting like 10 seconds for an answer or or if the system is quick enough in answering you also want to know okay how many customers are actually using my chatbot how much traffic am I receiving and does my llm system respond with error codes or is everything fine because I mean I think everyone of you has seen this like 404 or or with ch GPT or other providers there's there are error messages like hey something went wrong and that's what the user is seeing on the UI and is is like sad or desperate about it so we as developers of an llm system also want to know if our customers are seeing a lot of errors or or everything is going smooth and it's also no surprise that these systems are very resource hungry so we want to know about the saturation how much memory and GPU is my system using so this is referred to as the four golden signal so hey if you have a daop engineer in your company just just grabbed them and ask him to to add those also um to your llm system so that you not only have the quality metrics and the user feedback but that you also compl it with system metrics another nons surprising fact is that llms are not that cheap so if you have the time you should also invest in really monitoring and tracking the cost of your used infrastructure so typically you would have a vector store and an llm IPI that you are calling the vector store itself like I found it's not that expensive but what's really expensive if you either use a managed API for instance with open AI or other model providers you have to buy tokens and you have to pay for it per use so that might get expensive pretty quick or even if you're self host and you're running the model on gpus 24/7 then this can also increase the costs of your of your cloud provider or wherever you're using the gpus from but yeah here we also we won't have the time in this week to cover everything but you can read up on this LinkedIn post about it so thanks for listening in the next couple of videos we will really dive into the code so here for monitoring the answer quality of llms with metrics and um with those three we will uh write the python code together and equip our system store the metrics in a pogress database and use grafana to visualize it so we will build the code together and I will share it with you then in the GitHub repository and same same for monitoring the user feedback we will prepare all the python code to to store the chat sessions and collect the user feedback in in also post CR and then create a cunner dashboard to visualize it over time so see you in the next video Free LLM course: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp\",\n",

       "  'text': \"welcome back this is LM Zoom camp and in this series of videos we're talking about evaluation and monitoring we have talked a lot about offline evaluation and in the last few videos we talked about online evaluation but mostly in the last two videos we talked about capturing using feedback and for that we uh put together uh everything we did so far plus uh like we put it in Doos plus we uh started putting all the uh in postgress database so now we know what exactly is happening we also can capture thumbs down thumbs up from users uh so this way we can get user feedback we also talked about uh different types of um uh using llm as a judge for evaluating the relevancy of the responses and one of them was QA relevancy or question answer relevancy where we can ask an llm give it to uh things question and answer and then it will tell us if this answer is actually relevant to the question or not so now we can uh add all of this into our monitoring system and this is what we're going to do uh today and we can build a dashboard that shows that in the last hour uh this many uh requests to ANM um the responses were were relevant the answers were relevant or not how many thumbs UPS thumbs down are there um how many input tokens how many prompt and uh completion tokens whe there how many how much time how much money we spend and things like that so this is what we are going to do in this video we are going to set up grafana which is a tool for creating a dashboard uh where all of these will be displayed in real time as and as a backend we will use postgress the database we created previously so in the previous video I used nlm to actually generate uh to guide me through what I should do and here I also want to do the same uh but I already prepared uh The Prompt that I will send to CLA and uh this is the prompt so first of all instead of just saying I want to use Ama or open AI I want to have more Choice what I use for the prompt and then I say that I want to add monitoring with grafana where I want to display display response time how much time it took to respond from llm right how many answers are relevant and quote for that is below but that is below and this is exactly our llm as a judge so this is called for relevancy um then starts for thumbs on thumbs up down then we just want to also show uh last five conversations um or last five uh conversations yeah like basically question and answers from all them then what kind of models we use uh then how many tokens we use and the costs right so this is all what we want to display and I just here say that we want to use postgress as the back end for that because in grafana there are could be many backends uh we already store our data in uh postgress so we don't need any other database for that and here I give the code that we used before and uh yeah so here I say that let's include all that so I have repared this prompt and let us put it here and see what happens yep so the assistant uh we need to modify of course a few things uh so here llm yeah so the first one is we choose different uh let me just copy and then we will analyze what exactly we changed so where is the llm thing so here it is right so instead of just having a Lama and open AI we have something more so we have I need to add import time so for llm now we have uh um answer which is the text but also uh number of tokens right uh how much time it took atend so now it actually returns these three things um okay so next thing uh let me see assistant uh yeah we have aate relevancy right uh so this is something new uh I also need to add uh Json Json and note that uh what it also added is this TR accept thing so when it cannot uh parse the output so it says that the relevancy is unknown right um and finally this get answer so it is uh here okay and yeah so this is a cost calculation so for cost calculation perhaps we should actually move it to separate uh function um model Choice um tokens return cost okay and then of course yeah we can check how much it actually costs um like this values are maybe not real cuz like for me it's definitely less uh but for now I'll just keep these values as um as this and we can replace them later cost search text uh and for the cost yeah open I cost okay so um now in addition to answer we return a lot of extra stuff right response time relevance explanation model used how many tokens we used uh and so on right um I would yeah it's okay I mean I would uh maybe another thing is we can uh lock each invocation of llm where we would lock tokens cuz here we actually had two invocations right uh so first uh this one and then evaluate relevancy that was another invocation of an llm but it's okay we can leave it like that so of course uh um there are many different ways of doing the same thing okay now what do we have here uh so we have a new uh let me just copy the entire thing and we'll see what actually has changed of course we don't want this thing so get feedback stats uh this is a new I don't know why we need to to get it cuz um in grafana I don't think we will be invoking these functions but okay whatever uh save feedback so this is uh we already had it right and then save conversation there is much more that we save now uh yeah so everything is here so all these things we save into the database and now uh yeah so our schema is uh contains more things so these are all the things we look and the rest I don't think uh changed much what did we have here um yeah just empty empty lines and here I think we uh replaced uh yeah so nothing is interesting here okay so this is it the next one updating the stream lit app so I will again copy the entire thing and put it here and see what changes um okay so um here yeah the choices for models are different uh here yeah we display some monitor information I don't think it's actually um that needed but okay why not right um since we save it to the database we might as well just also display it this is not something we would display to an Exel user but for us uh in order to see it why not uh feedback buttons um okay displayer I I I Now understand why we have this if we want to see this immediately in stream lead up why not right and then why did it stop okay continue so I think it uh it was just generating too much uh code that's why maybe it stopped um so yeah let's see where it finished okay so almost finished okay and now where are we updated toer compos with grafana okay so here we have grafana so this is uh the Tool uh we are going to use for build in the dashboard and yeah gra one data okay and now what we can do is just do do compose up and um run it so let's see this what up uh yeah I'm not running it so it should restart everything and first um the thir thing we will need to do is we will need to uh regenerate our data uh and that we by regenerating our data I mean um we need to run the script again so then we um where it is so we initialize the database right so I do python uh prep probably it will complain now about uh uh I don't know if it can connect to uh the database right so here this is so we need to set it to Local Host so so I'll do hey expert Local Host now run it one more time it kind of take it just take ages I don't know if it's doing something or it's trying to connect but cannot um yeah so it's it actually should be running we see some postgress locks yeah so I see some locks from postgress okay so it has initialized the database um so we dropped everything we had and created a new database with a new schema right and the next thing we want to do is I want to check if um this is still working so I want to go to Local Host um what was the Port this one and I want to quickly ask something so just to make sure it works so I don't think this is the this is the old version yeah so we did not rebuild it so let's rebuild it uh we can do Docker compos stop stream lit do compos built stream L because we updated the app right um and now we do Docker compose start stream L okay and I will restart it and yeah here we have the new data and I think um actually from what I notice I remember I was struggling with locks with same locks I can see the locks now so it's kind of cool so now I can enter a question so let's use Vector search and use GPT 40 mini to ask a question about data engineer zom camp and let's ask so yeah we can see some logs that's cool uh then uh we see some stats um and this is not correct I think cuz we actually use GPT for all mini but this is something we can adjust later I don't want to to change it right now um we'll do it later and this is something that is kind of cool but not really needed right now so in principle we just see that it works okay so where did we stop so now we need to access grafana and the default one uh is admin admin so let me then set new password to admin admin and now we I want to add my first data source which is postgress postgress and uh so it's postgress database name course assistant is it course assistant uh where is our course assistant uh postgress user your username your password uh we don't need SSL and save it as okay it works um go away no okay now we need to create our first dashboard so for this dashboard we will will add a new pel and here we have some SQL um SQL queries that we want to um show uh here um from what I see the problem with the these SQL queries okay I can copy it here uh where is the Run button okay run button yeah we don't have anything that's one thing uh so maybe before I explain what the problem is with these SQL queries we need to generate some uh some data right so right now nothing is there uh I want to have another uh another script like we have this prep script uh the one that generates um PL data I think I have a prompt I also prepared The Prompt for that here let's create a script that generates on synthetic data uh first put data in previous periods between now and 6 hours ago um so we want uh to retroactively put some data there like for the last 6 hours so we can see the charts and also add some test data that is in being inserted right now so we can see data changing in grafana so let's do that and then we will come back and update uh the scripts okay so first it was uh generating synthetic data uh for like previous time period uh where did it go data it's kind of weird but okay like I was hoping it would just use safe conversation and put the time stamp where there but it's trying to do this strange thing but okay I will copy it now and call it uh generate data by um okay and I will invoke it here python generate data okay I was hoping to have more locks uh but okay let's see if we actually have anything in our data yeah now we do and here if we change it to last five minutes or last 30 minutes yeah it actually works so there are no problems so I think it actually grafana modifies the queries right so it also adds limits there this is what I wanted to add here like because there are some you can get start time and end time uh so for example from now - 3 hours to to now- 2 hours yeah it actually works fine so forget what I said this query is great um how we will call it so this is response time so this will be our first uh 6 hours be our first um pel so we will add another one here another one is relevance distribution panel so select code here I click this button and then um so here we have relevant non relevant uh do oh no no no no maybe okay so nonrelevant relevant partly relevant um it's count uh yeah counts are good too like we can also uh use uh perhaps fractions but also why not counts you can adjust this query if you want and by the way I think I should be also save in this so then you can later use it to so I'll all this um graph queries MD and this is the first query the second is this so this response time panel right then relevance distribution panel let me just copy all of them and I'll edit it right now so relevance distribution panel that was it right SQL so this this is something we will do now right so let's uh add this one and create a new another one so again I use code here I put this code here run query and is it again relance um yeah I don't want this cuz we just did that right SQL so this is this one model used and yeah let's go with this one um so panel title will be model used so here we forgot to change the title will be relevance see and you see it changed because the data is being generated and it is uh updated it so we can actually refresh dashboard or keep it automatically updated every 5 every 5 seconds or whatever we want like every minute uh to make it more interactive let's put it to 5 seconds so the next one is a token usage panel right so this is our tokens so this how many tokens um we use it's total tokens we can of course also split it uh into um like different typ types of tokens apply uh okay what else um actually I'm here open ey cost panel so this is the cost we can also add a breakdown here by uh different costs of different models um but I will leave it just total cost this is something you can do too and the last one is recent conversations maybe it's the last one I don't remember no no it's not the last one but this one is just last five conversations add a new panel vot run query and this will be a table right uh last five conversations okay so does it like it should I think there is incorrect time stamp because right now for me it's actually 20 yeah so I think this is something we will fix later but like it's there are dates from the future uh and feedback so this one okay let's go with maybe pie chart I'll call it like that okay so this is this looks okay of course we can uh arrange it a little bit maybe oops where did you go so we can arrange it like we want can you go here okay tokens model used uh yeah maybe like that and then of course like if we want to check it over the last 30 minutes this is how we do it last 5 minutes uh last 6 hours okay so it's more or less done the only thing that is left is uh fixing this one uh so here we don't we cannot properly see the last answers and this is a back I think it's a back in uh our um where it is generate data because let me check how we add time stamp here um Cent time yeah maybe the way we do this I think we need to add time Z on cuz clearly I see here from the time stamps that this is data from the past or from the future right not not the current one so probably it's adding you stuff here but um yeah even though it's heading there are records with um more current time stamps okay so let's uh ask it to correct it there is a problem with I'll just put it on pause finish the prompt and then we'll see it uh so this The Prompt he said that it's a problem with the data generator since it doesn't use the time zone some of the generated data previously has future time stop and then I say where I am and it should now modify the script uh we should also recreate a database right okay so while it's finishing that I will stop generating the data and then I'll run this so we clean the we withraw the table and create a new one so we don't have any dat there and when we do this our dashboard will stop working I think let me actually save it first and we can call it um course assistant but yeah there is no data now right cuz we recreated it and now oh where is it oh I also need to install by TZ okay is there any way to avoid that like hope I have it inst can we do it with without byz um yeah so right now I have um python 12 so this one should work um but also note that in um in streamly tab I think we use 3.9 yeah so since it's available from 3.9 it should be fine okay so let me copy it I will update now and I also kind of want to see some logs here let's add print statements so I see what's happening because right now I just say okay I generated some data but um like it doesn't really say uh what what kind of things it outputs um so right now it's creating this file so I did not commit it to get the that's why I actually don't know now when I over over wrote this file I just did contrl a contrl v so I don't know which part it actually changed so sometimes I think it could be uh a bit dangerous right CU um like when you copy the entire file content but yeah let's see dangerous in a sense that um yeah you don't know what changed so um let me run it I think yeah this one okay so now yeah it is actually showing what it's doing better and now we can yeah already and now it's good so now if we it like I wanted to see new stuff here some reasons it it's not working so I don't know why so there there's there are still some um yeah it's weird so I I'll debug it and then uh um I'll put it on pause debug it and then tell you what to do okay so I just asked it that I have this weird case I didn't really debug it so I will just use an updated code and see and hope for the best right so here where we do have it generate synthetic data and and then right okay I'll stop it um so this one and then we also it also updated the DB file did it update the entire file okay so it also added time zone info there DB which means I will need to which means I'll need to rebuild the this thing I guess um like I don't know why I just can't take my date uh from my computer for some reasons it cannot um yeah so now I'll rebuild it re execute and then show you the results okay so I just rebuild it and here when I refresh it we can see new data right and um so this is generated in the by the script I want to stop the script so the script is stopped and now I want to actually use our app and we should be able to see what we did now so this is the question I asked let's use a vector search uh engine and then ask the query and we get the response uh with some statistics and now if I update it I should see I should see it I don't for some reasons uh okay yeah cuz um yeah like too much on um AI it's probably not great but at least I know what to do now um I don't think I should uh torture you now with like rebuilding it again you can just I'll finish the code I'll commit the code and you can check it uh like the main thing the main outcome of this module is this dashboard so now we can see last conversations we can see user feedback we can see relevancy as detected by LM a judge we can track costs we can track tokens we can see what model is used the response time too um so now I'll fix that I'll commit the code and this thing is will be working so you can just um use it okay I hope it was fun uh still I was hoping I would need to do less live debugging than in the previous video yeah this video is again 40 minutes long well I hope hope this is entertaining I hope you learned a lot and this is it for this moduel it's been a lot of information um so probably will take some time for you to digest it and now yeah I I'll need to prepare some homework so you will have fun with the homework too so see you soon\",\n",

all of this into our monitoring system and this is what we're going to do uh today and we can build a dashboard that shows that in the last hour uh this many uh requests to ANM um the responses were were relevant the answers were relevant or not how many thumbs UPS thumbs down are there um how many input tokens how many prompt and uh completion tokens whe there how many how much time how much money we spend and things like that so this is what we are going to do in this video we are going to set up grafana which is a tool for creating a dashboard uh where all of these will be displayed in real time as and as a backend we will use postgress the database we created previously so in the previous video I used nlm to actually generate uh to guide me through what I should do and here I also want to do the same uh but I already prepared uh The Prompt that I will send to CLA and uh this is the prompt so first of all instead of just saying I want to use Ama or open AI I want to have more Choice what I use for the prompt and then I say that I want to add monitoring with grafana where I want to display display response time how much time it took to respond from llm right how many answers are relevant and quote for that is below but that is below and this is exactly our llm as a judge so this is called for relevancy um then starts for thumbs on thumbs up down then we just want to also show uh last five conversations um or last five uh conversations yeah like basically question and answers from all them then what kind of models we use uh then how many tokens we use and the costs right so this is all what we want to display and I just here say that we want to use postgress as the back end for that because in grafana there are could be many backends uh we already store our data in uh postgress so we don't need any other database for that and here I give the code that we used before and uh yeah so here I say that let's include all that so I have repared this prompt and let us put it here and see what happens yep so the assistant uh we need to modify of course a few things uh so here llm yeah so the first one is we choose different uh let me just copy and then we will analyze what exactly we changed so where is the llm thing so here it is right so instead of just having a Lama and open AI we have something more so we have I need to add import time so for llm now we have uh um answer which is the text but also uh number of tokens right uh how much time it took atend so now it actually returns these three things um okay so next thing uh let me see assistant uh yeah we have aate relevancy right uh so this is something new uh I also need to add uh Json Json and note that uh what it also added is this TR accept thing so when it cannot uh parse the output so it says that the relevancy is unknown right um and finally this get answer so it is uh here okay and yeah so this is a cost calculation so for cost calculation perhaps we should actually move it to separate uh function um model Choice um tokens return cost okay and then of course yeah we can check how much it actually costs um like this values are maybe not real cuz like for me it's definitely less uh but for now I'll just keep these values as um as this and we can replace them later cost search text uh and for the cost yeah open I cost okay so um now in addition to answer we return a lot of extra stuff right response time relevance explanation model used how many tokens we used uh and so on right um I would yeah it's okay I mean I would uh maybe another thing is we can uh lock each invocation of llm where we would lock tokens cuz here we actually had two invocations right uh so first uh this one and then evaluate relevancy that was another invocation of an llm but it's okay we can leave it like that so of course uh um there are many different ways of doing the same thing okay now what do we have here uh so we have a new uh let me just copy the entire thing and we'll see what actually has changed of course we don't want this thing so get feedback stats uh this is a new I don't know why we need to to get it cuz um in grafana I don't think we will be invoking these functions but okay whatever uh save feedback so this is uh we already had it right and then save conversation there is much more that we save now uh yeah so everything is here so all these things we save into the database and now uh yeah so our schema is uh contains more things so these are all the things we look and the rest I don't think uh changed much what did we have here um yeah just empty empty lines and here I think we uh replaced uh yeah so nothing is interesting here okay so this is it the next one updating the stream lit app so I will again copy the entire thing and put it here and see what changes um okay so um here yeah the choices for models are different uh here yeah we display some monitor information I don't think it's actually um that needed but okay why not right um since we save it to the database we might as well just also display it this is not something we would display to an Exel user but for us uh in order to see it why not uh feedback buttons um okay displayer I I I Now understand why we have this if we want to see this immediately in stream lead up why not right and then why did it stop okay continue so I think it uh it was just generating too much uh code that's why maybe it stopped um so yeah let's see where it finished okay so almost finished okay and now where are we updated toer compos with grafana okay so here we have grafana so this is uh the Tool uh we are going to use for build in the dashboard and yeah gra one data okay and now what we can do is just do do compose up and um run it so let's see this what up uh yeah I'm not running it so it should restart everything and first um the thir thing we will need to do is we will need to uh regenerate our data uh and that we by regenerating our data I mean um we need to run the script again so then we um where it is so we initialize the database right so I do python uh prep probably it will complain now about uh uh I don't know if it can connect to uh the database right so here this is so we need to set it to Local Host so so I'll do hey expert Local Host now run it one more time it kind of take it just take ages I don't know if it's doing something or it's trying to connect but cannot um yeah so it's it actually should be running we see some postgress locks yeah so I see some locks from postgress okay so it has initialized the database um so we dropped everything we had and created a new database with a new schema right and the next thing we want to do is I want to check if um this is still working so I want to go to Local Host um what was the Port this one and I want to quickly ask something so just to make sure it works so I don't think this is the this is the old version yeah so we did not rebuild it so let's rebuild it uh we can do Docker compos stop stream lit do compos built stream L because we updated the app right um and now we do Docker compose start stream L okay and I will restart it and yeah here we have the new data and I think um actually from what I notice I remember I was struggling with locks with same locks I can see the locks now so it's kind of cool so now I can enter a question so let's use Vector search and use GPT 40 mini to ask a question about data engineer zom camp and let's ask so yeah we can see some logs that's cool uh then uh we see some stats um and this is not correct I think cuz we actually use GPT for all mini but this is something we can adjust later I don't want to to change it right now um we'll do it later and this is something that is kind of cool but not really needed right now so in principle we just see that it works okay so where did we stop so now we need to access grafana and the default one uh is admin admin so let me then set new password to admin admin and now we I want to add my first data source which is postgress postgress and uh so it's postgress database name course assistant is it course assistant uh where is our course assistant uh postgress user your username your password uh we don't need SSL and save it as okay it works um go away no okay now we need to create our first dashboard so for this dashboard we will will add a new pel and here we have some SQL um SQL queries that we want to um show uh here um from what I see the problem with the these SQL queries okay I can copy it here uh where is the Run button okay run button yeah we don't have anything that's one thing uh so maybe before I explain what the problem is with these SQL queries we need to generate some uh some data right so right now nothing is there uh I want to have another uh another script like we have this prep script uh the one that generates um PL data I think I have a prompt I also prepared The Prompt for that here let's create a script that generates on synthetic data uh first put data in previous periods between now and 6 hours ago um so we want uh to retroactively put some data there like for the last 6 hours so we can see the charts and also add some test data that is in being inserted right now so we can see data changing in grafana so let's do that and then we will come back and update uh the scripts okay so first it was uh generating synthetic data uh for like previous time period uh where did it go data it's kind of weird but okay like I was hoping it would just use safe conversation and put the time stamp where there but it's trying to do this strange thing but okay I will copy it now and call it uh generate data by um okay and I will invoke it here python generate data okay I was hoping to have more locks uh but okay let's see if we actually have anything in our data yeah now we do and here if we change it to last five minutes or last 30 minutes yeah it actually works so there are no problems so I think it actually grafana modifies the queries right so it also adds limits there this is what I wanted to add here like because there are some you can get start time and end time uh so for example from now - 3 hours to to now- 2 hours yeah it actually works fine so forget what I said this query is great um how we will call it so this is response time so this will be our first uh 6 hours be our first um pel so we will add another one here another one is relevance distribution panel so select code here I click this button and then um so here we have relevant non relevant uh do oh no no no no maybe okay so nonrelevant relevant partly relevant um it's count uh yeah counts are good too like we can also uh use uh perhaps fractions but also why not counts you can adjust this query if you want and by the way I think I should be also save in this so then you can later use it to so I'll all this um graph queries MD and this is the first query the second is this so this response time panel right then relevance distribution panel let me just copy all of them and I'll edit it right now so relevance distribution panel that was it right SQL so this this is something we will do now right so let's uh add this one and create a new another one so again I use code here I put this code here run query and is it again relance um yeah I don't want this cuz we just did that right SQL so this is this one model used and yeah let's go with this one um so panel title will be model used so here we forgot to change the title will be relevance see and you see it changed because the data is being generated and it is uh updated it so we can actually refresh dashboard or keep it automatically updated every 5 every 5 seconds or whatever we want like every minute uh to make it more interactive let's put it to 5 seconds so the next one is a token usage panel right so this is our tokens so this how many tokens um we use it's total tokens we can of course also split it uh into um like different typ types of tokens apply uh okay what else um actually I'm here open ey cost panel so this is the cost we can also add a breakdown here by uh different costs of different models um but I will leave it just total cost this is something you can do too and the last one is recent conversations maybe it's the last one I don't remember no no it's not the last one but this one is just last five conversations add a new panel vot run query and this will be a table right uh last five conversations okay so does it like it should I think there is incorrect time stamp because right now for me it's actually 20 yeah so I think this is something we will fix later but like it's there are dates from the future uh and feedback so this one okay let's go with maybe pie chart I'll call it like that okay so this is this looks okay of course we can uh arrange it a little bit maybe oops where did you go so we can arrange it like we want can you go here okay tokens model used uh yeah maybe like that and then of course like if we want to check it over the last 30 minutes this is how we do it last 5 minutes uh last 6 hours okay so it's more or less done the only thing that is left is uh fixing this one uh so here we don't we cannot properly see the last answers and this is a back I think it's a back in uh our um where it is generate data because let me check how we add time stamp here um Cent time yeah maybe the way we do this I think we need to add time Z on cuz clearly I see here from the time stamps that this is data from the past or from the future right not not the current one so probably it's adding you stuff here but um yeah even though it's heading there are records with um more current time stamps okay so let's uh ask it to correct it there is a problem with I'll just put it on pause finish the prompt and then we'll see it uh so this The Prompt he said that it's a problem with the data generator since it doesn't use the time zone some of the generated data previously has future time stop and then I say where I am and it should now modify the script uh we should also recreate a database right okay so while it's finishing that I will stop generating the data and then I'll run this so we clean the we withraw the table and create a new one so we don't have any dat there and when we do this our dashboard will stop working I think let me actually save it first and we can call it um course assistant but yeah there is no data now right cuz we recreated it and now oh where is it oh I also need to install by TZ okay is there any way to avoid that like hope I have it inst can we do it with without byz um yeah so right now I have um python 12 so this one should work um but also note that in um in streamly tab I think we use 3.9 yeah so since it's available from 3.9 it should be fine okay so let me copy it I will update now and I also kind of want to see some logs here let's add print statements so I see what's happening because right now I just say okay I generated some data but um like it doesn't really say uh what what kind of things it outputs um so right now it's creating this file so I did not commit it to get the that's why I actually don't know now when I over over wrote this file I just did contrl a contrl v so I don't know which part it actually changed so sometimes I think it could be uh a bit dangerous right CU um like when you copy the entire file content but yeah let's see dangerous in a sense that um yeah you don't know what changed so um let me run it I think yeah this one okay so now yeah it is actually showing what it's doing better and now we can yeah already and now it's good so now if we it like I wanted to see new stuff here some reasons it it's not working so I don't know why so there there's there are still some um yeah it's weird so I I'll debug it and then uh um I'll put it on pause debug it and then tell you what to do okay so I just asked it that I have this weird case I didn't really debug it so I will just use an updated code and see and hope for the best right so here where we do have it generate synthetic data and and then right okay I'll stop it um so this one and then we also it also updated the DB file did it update the entire file okay so it also added time zone info there DB which means I will need to which means I'll need to rebuild the this thing I guess um like I don't know why I just can't take my date uh from my computer for some reasons it cannot um yeah so now I'll rebuild it re execute and then show you the results okay so I just rebuild it and here when I refresh it we can see new data right and um so this is generated in the by the script I want to stop the script so the script is stopped and now I want to actually use our app and we should be able to see what we did now so this is the question I asked let's use a vector search uh engine and then ask the query and we get the response uh with some statistics and now if I update it I should see I should see it I don't for some reasons uh okay yeah cuz um yeah like too much on um AI it's probably not great but at least I know what to do now um I don't think I should uh torture you now with like rebuilding it again you can just I'll finish the code I'll commit the code and you can check it uh like the main thing the main outcome of this module is this dashboard so now we can see last conversations we can see user feedback we can see relevancy as detected by LM a judge we can track costs we can track tokens we can see what model is used the response time too um so now I'll fix that I'll commit the code and this thing is will be working so you can just um use it okay I hope it was fun uh still I was hoping I would need to do less live debugging than in the previous video yeah this video is again 40 minutes long well I hope hope this is entertaining I hope you learned a lot and this is it for this moduel it's been a lot of information um so probably will take some time for you to digest it and now yeah I I'll need to prepare some homework so you will have fun with the homework too so see you soon Free LLM course: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp\",\n",

Json fog you worked with in the past and we can run this to then get the output we can see that there are three rows one for each course and each row has multiple documents within it we will split this up in a later stage now if you want to look at the code that's running underneath the hood or let's say you wanted to customize the code yourself you can click edit here and then you can open up the code editor and make any changes you want here In this section, we cover the ingestion of documents from a single data source.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"hello everyone this is module six of the llm zoom cam CSE my name is Tim and uh in this video I'm going to tell you about tips and tricks for advanced rack systems so in the previous modules we covered a lot of topics related to LMS and rack systems starting from the basics like how to launch your own rack system uh using for example um simple search engine or maybe using some kind of database like elastic search and so on then we move to uh to the parts related to orchestrating and monitoring R pipelines and now I think it's a time to cover the topics that could help you to improve your R systems uh but before we start uh let me uh remind you about uh the whole rack concept so what we have here we have a user with it a question or query like uh is it still possible to join to our course or can I still join to the course or maybe some specific tool specific uh question like how can I install Docker on my laptop and so on so our user can uh directly interact with our language model so language model will produce the answer the result but the problem is here that our language model doesn't have enough uh context about for example about our course and uh this answer uh may not be so precise or so appropriate that we want for such purposes we need to provide some additional uh information or context for our llm model so we can get this context from some uh knowledge database where we can store all this uh necessary information and after that we can add this context to our users uh question or query and uh in this case language model will provide uh the result in more precise manner we can say so uh now before we go to the different techniques I want to mention also ke Concepts to be sure that uh we have the same understanding about the components of our rack system uh when we build uh a r system we usually have uh two stages we can say the first stage is a indexing stage where where we actually ingest our data uh when we index the data in our case let it be um the FAQ documents related to the three different courses like ml Zoom Camp data engineering Zoom camp and MLM Zoom Camp so these three courses is general and maybe uh specific questions so what we need to do uh is we need to take this uh documents uh part them and then split into the chunks of texts uh our case we can do that in a pretty straightforward U way because our documents are well structured I mean you know each FAQ document uh consist of different sections uh where the question and answers listed one by one so now we can take these chunks and turn them into Vector form and then we can uh we can store these vectors in our database or in our knowledge base and this is what we need uh to do to prepare our data for the rack system um so uh the second stage is a Q&A stage uh what we can do here we can embed uh our users question into a vector as well and um given this Vector of numbers we can now search in our Vector database to find uh the top K closes document uh we can say the most relevant in the embedding space compared to the question that U we got asked then we can take our initial question enrich it with the most relevant documents as a context and send this data to our LM model and this is how it works end to end now we can jump into different techniques focusing on the mostly on the retrieval p uh the first technique um is called small to big chunk retrial uh the problem here is how to choose the right chunk size because chunk size is also our parameter if the chunk size is too large uh for example uh equal to an entire section maybe or the entire paragraph then um when when we will embed those chunks we will probably have too much noise uh in the uh our embeddings and we will probably not be able to retrieve the relevant documents because the relevant data we can say uh gets lost in large amount of data of data information on the other hand if we choose a small chunk size we can miss the essential piece of data and our model could return an incomplete answer due to the lack of context so one of the ways to solve this problem is to use both start from the small Chun small chunks and then go to the big one this means that on the indexing stage we should use small chunks to put them in our storage to our database for example we can make embeddings of the single sentences but on the step when we uh provide the the context to our L model we could retrieve and combine several uh chunks related for example to the same topic that's how the first tip uh looks like moving on the second technique is uh called leveraging document metadata so some metadata describing those documents sing it can be things like you know uh title of the documents year o and so on and so forth it's some additional information um describing our documents in some sort of cases uh we can start from the simple documents name or pass to the documents or any kind of folder structure and on top of that what we can do is to make topic model from the classic NLP world iing and then we extract several topics related uh to the information discussed in in our documents and of course we can also do it with llms we can just ask a language model to extract the attributes characterizing our documents that was technique number two if you have a madata or if you don't have metadata then generate it and try to make use of it when you are providing the context to language model technique number three is a hybrid search so in a hybrid search we are combining two methods of doing the search it's a vector based search and the keyword based search in a vctor uh in a vector uh based search we make the embeddings of the source documents and then we find the documents that have the closest distance in the embedding space so this search is based on the semantic meaning keyword search is just a lexical search one to one match over the worlds we are just manually going through the through the text and trying to find words that uh that we are looking for so if we find this words this will be a match in some cases keybord based search may actually be um useful uh for example when our documents contain a lot of domain specific terms or maybe abbreviations um related to some topic uh so what we can do here we can combine both Vector search and keyboard uh key keyword based search in our uh search pipeline it means that given a user question we will actually run two search by plans in a parallel that was technique number three so uh what about technique number four it's called user query rewriting what the problem is here um as a user of the language models we are not always uh good at formulating our questions uh I mean in a very specific precise uh and concise manner some users um can be asking more informal questions and also include a lot of noise and uh a lot of words that are we can say not IR revent to the actual search so what we can do with this problem well uh we should reformulate user question in in a better structured uh search query and one of the ways you can do that um is to ask a separate language model to reformulate the initial user query uh that we can then take it turn to the vector form and retrieve the revent CHS according to this uh reformulated question or query that was technique number four so moving on and the last one the technique number five is document raning here the problem may may be when we retrieve the documents from our database uh using a bing similarity approach our chunks will be ranking let's say uh by cassine similarities between the vectors which is a good measure but might not always be the best measure to actually reflect how relevant the embedding uh of document uh is for answering this particular user uh this particular user questions it may be that we are only extracting top five documents to show them to the llm but actually the the document that contain the answer for our question was on the sixth place and we missed that because we ordered our documents by the cassin similarity criteria what we can do here uh basically the answer to that problem is trying to reun the chunks after we have already retrieved them one of the ways how we can U do that is uh again leveraging the language model instead of a single language call we actually have two calls to the language model the first one asking to rank our chunks of text and then step number two answering the question using the top chunks from the uh ranking list that we got from the previous tab so that were all five techniques that I wanted to cover in this video of course there are many other techniques out of this but these five are just we can say the most popular and here I give you just a brief overview of this techniques if you want to dive in this topic to explore it in more details please refer to this video recorded by Alexa and Nikita you can find it in the webinar playlist also I would like to add that in this module among all these techniques we will focus only on two of them I search and the writing part and uh that's all for this video see you soon\",\n",

moving on and the last one the technique number five is document raning here the problem may may be when we retrieve the documents from our database uh using a bing similarity approach our chunks will be ranking let's say uh by cassine similarities between the vectors which is a good measure but might not always be the best measure to actually reflect how relevant the embedding uh of document uh is for answering this particular user uh this particular user questions it may be that we are only extracting top five documents to show them to the llm but actually the the document that contain the answer for our question was on the sixth place and we missed that because we ordered our documents by the cassin similarity criteria what we can do here uh basically the answer to that problem is trying to reun the chunks after we have already retrieved them one of the ways how we can U do that is uh again leveraging the language model instead of a single language call we actually have two calls to the language model the first one asking to rank our chunks of text and then step number two answering the question using the top chunks from the uh ranking list that we got from the previous tab so that were all five techniques that I wanted to cover in this video of course there are many other techniques out of this but these five are just we can say the most popular and here I give you just a brief overview of this techniques if you want to dive in this topic to explore it in more details please refer to this video recorded by Alexa and Nikita you can find it in the webinar playlist also I would like to add that in this module among all these techniques we will focus only on two of them I search and the writing part and uh that's all for this video see you soon In this video, we discuss the most popular techniques to improve your RAG pipeline.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"hello everyone this is video number two of the module six of LM Zoom camp in this module we discuss best practices different tricks and techniques to improve our R pipeline in the previous video I give you a brief overview of the five different techniques these five are just we can say the most popular and as I mentioned before we are not going to explore each Topic in details we will just focus only on two of these techniques aarch and ranking and this video is exactly about the H search H search is based on the combination of two methods Vector search and keyword search in Vector search we use vectorization to transform our initial text into embeddings or in other words into a bunch of numbers we make the edings of the source documents put them into our database and then we find the documents that have the closest distance to the user's query in the embedding space keyword search is more about one to one match over the words so the idea of hybrid search is to combine both approaches in one Pipeline and the question is how we can do that so we can do that in a pretty straightforward way basically each search here on theal part or dble stage produces results ranking by scores and we can take these scores and me them by using such simple equation in this equation Alpha determines U the weights assigned to each score with values typically ranging between 0 and one so in the case of alpha equals to one we get view Vector search otherwise this IP equals to zero so our equation transforms to the pure K and that's all about this Z now it's time to implement a hybd search what we have here so I have already launched a python in my code spaces environment I also started elastic search in the do container in a spaces also and prepared a old sketch so in this module we are going to use code from the notebooks from the module number three in the module three we cover topics related uh to the vector search uh vector. databases vector and sematic search and Ral part also also about evaluation matrics and so on and uh I just opened one of these notebooks to be precise this one evaluate Vector so in this notebook Alexi implemented a vector [Music] search and uh write all evolation functions and culate several metcs like heat rate and Mr and I just uh copy paste first lines of this code from The alexas Notebook to this new notebook of course I made some cosmetic changes for example I move all the Imports to the beginning of this notebook deleted some useless cells and so on but the whole pipeline stay the same we imported the necessary modules then we loaded our documents with questions answers and documents IDs then we loaded model uh that we that we use to build edings for our documents and finally set up elastic search settings and index our documents so in this blocks I guess this is the most important or most interesting part because in this blocks we have Vector search implementation by using KNN algorithm so let's try to experiment with this part now we want to change this Vector search in such a way as to turn it into hybrid search we know that we are using elastic search for storing our data for storing our documents that's why we can directly go to the Google or maybe to the official documentation and try to find information about hybrid search this is what I have already done and uh I found a couple of pages related to hybrid search impementation in elastic search so as you can see from this uh page to build our hrid search it will be enough just to take two uh parts I mean Vector search and our standard keyword search and put everything together in one in one place in this case the final score for each hit will be calculated the sum of the KNN and query scores we can also specify a boost par here to give a weight uh to each score in our sum so uh let's try to repeat this so uh here we have a search yeah and uh for implementing a hybrid search we need to copy paste a piece of code from another notebook in module 3 where Alex implemented just a simple uh keyw matching search so this not look called evaluate text and here we need just this part let's call it here search and here we have our default uh question like I just discovered the course can I still join it now we are going to vectorize our initial query users query now we are running can query ah yeah also we need to add uh of course we need to add a filter here and uh let me change this part my this key yeah get and there have C name let me check it cross yeah now I found this problem that was because we don't need these two lines of code Al we just need to combine Canon query and key query and now as you can see it works also what we we can do we can add this boost values to each part by default we can use uh 0.5 values and let me check play to move it inside want to match as you can see our scores in our search they changed that's all I think we implemented uh simple I resarch now I guess it's time to rewrite the whole pipeline let's call it um I research we line here I'm also my I'm going to take Cod Snippets from the Alexa snow look so what we need here of course we should load ground through dos um from this one so what we need we need also functions to culate our Matrix like great and Mr [Music] score so cells also we need the elastic search [Music] function but we are of course have to modify it and we need also this relation function and [Music] need this question can so now we are going to the right we will start from the elastic search Cann let's rename it like El search F and here we need to put course we need to put our modified [Music] pm and and also we need to add keyword very part yeah I also forget to mention one important thing I guess here we don't need to implement boosting for separate parts of our uh keyword search like we do in the first modules maybe you remember that we waited additionally U boosted addition of the question part just uh to make sure that our search algorithm will pay much more attention to this part but now I guess we don't need this that's why I deleted this boosting because uh now we are going to play with this boost variables just to to find the trade all between the vector search and um keyword search so let's try to add here our qu part G and also we need specify the size yeah it's the size of the theant answers that will return our search because K algorithm return five five elements here also our keyword search where return five elements uh it would be a 10 elements in some but we don't need to change the length of our answer that's why we need to specify the size uh of our query here and I think that's all next we need to modify this uh question Vector function let's call it just question h and uh yeah I forget just to change the list of params that our function elastic search hrid will take so we need here build the vector uh yeah also we need quy here because quy is needed for our keyword search and now we need also change the power punction here so it should be you stay the same Vector course and we need to change sare here would be question Y and last think we need to check our evolation function it seems like we don't need to make any changes in our evolation function now we can just call our evolation function to run the whole Pipeline and calculate our scores our Matrix heat rate and [Music] Mr also I would like to copy paste the score so that Alexa got by calling this function using simple Vector search I just put it heretic search sear and we need to pass to our Rel function ground TRS and our such function that hold question hybrid sear Canon is not defined yeah here we need also to change the name of our function purose yeah it will take some time to calculate our scores to run the whole pipeline what we can do while while we are waiting we of course can copy paste other functions uh to run it not only on questions but also on answers on documents answers and also as you remember we buil three types of embeddings on our questions and our answers and uh the third one the third one was U we combined just conate answers is questions and also build a bendings so uh for each of these cases we need to write the independent uh function so the second one will be this one let's name it text [Music] other pars we don't need to change them I guess and uh need to change the name of our search function yeah the first calculation was finished and as you can see we improved our scores the heat rate was increased by uh I think by 15% also we we improved our Mr score significantly that's great so now let's try to run our next function we calculate uh we calculate this course using KNN under uh can over the answers of our questions yeah there the last one our research um questions and answers what your name I [Music] so our second run also improved our Matrix and Mr but in a comparison with our po run where we implemented search over than only questions so I can say that we get better scores here looks like we get the same scores yeah but anyway they better than the scores that we got using just the simple Vector search and it's finished now we can compare our scores with the scores that Alexi got in his notebook Y and in the case number three where we used question answers uh embeddings we got the Matrix the metric Valu is slightly better than in previous cases and also better than lxa got in the modle three a pure Vector search so it seems that our har search has a benefits I'm pretty sure that's not the limit and we can further increase our metrix by by playing with this boost PM Bo values for the instance we can increase the weight value for k for km part for example and that will increase its impact on the final score but of course we need to carry on some additional experiments to prove this Theory so let's summarize uh H research uh looks like a linear combination of two parts um the vector search and key search um in this video we implemented fi search by using the functionality of the elastic search so then we um we borrowed the code from The alexas Notebook where he implemented the vector search and the vector search Pipeline and calculated the Matrix uh we uh slightly modify this code by um by adding keyword matching to the search and then we run all these three cases for the question bendings for the answer bendings and question with answer Bings and calculated the metrix in each case as as you can see we have managed to improve our metrics of course I will add all this uh notebooks and all these links to the GitHub repo um and I think it's it's enough for this video thank you very much see you soon\",\n",

a hybrid search we discussed how it works then implemented it using function analy of the elastic search and improved our metrics the heat rate and Mr so in this video we will speak about the next technique called documentary ranking first of all let's repeat what the problem we are dealing with here on the slide you can see our Pipeline with a hybrid search part that effectively combines various search techniques like vector and keyword searches both the vector and keyword search interact with the database to retrieve a relevant chks of data the relevant chunks from both searches are combined into a single set and then pass through a reranking process because we need the limited amount of chunks that we want to show them to our language model during this process each Chun is assigned a score based on its relevance with the user's query the chunks are sorted based on their course with the most rant chance appearing at the top so reranking is a process of pre-ordering a set of retrieved documents in order to improve such relevance its core principles involves calculating the relevant score between the user's question and the each document then returning a list of documents ordered by relevance from the highest to lowest typically the search process precedes rank as calculating rence scores between a query and millions of documents is highly inefficient therefore ranking is often positioned at the end of the search process making it ideal for managing and sourcing results from various search systems how we can Implement document ranking there are multiple techniques starting from the simple implementations like various her istics and uh rules and using specific models for ranking our chunks also one of the way one of the ways how we can do that is again leveraging the language model in this case we actually have two calls to the language model the first one asking to rank our chunks of texts and the second one answering the question using the top chunks for the from the ranking list that we got from the previous t and of course we should build our reranking process based on some relevance score on the slide you can see some common options that we can take like NCG main average Precision reciprocal rank fusion and so on you can Google some extra information about this metrix or you can just ask a charge PT and in this video we will use reciprocal rank Fusion or RF for short that combines the ranks of documents from multiple search methods you can ask why not just use the cin similarity here so the cassin similarity is a good measure for the calculating the distance between two embeddings but may not necessarily be the best measure to actually reflect how relevant this Chun to the initial user query at least because in our case we use a combination of the search techniques but not only a vector search well move on and what about about the ranking in the elastic search let's add rest to the documentation there are multiple ways how we can Implement R ranking in the elastic search by using building function anality or calling the external models and apis I think we will start with a simple approach in our search function we can specify we can specify a special param called rank where we can pass ourf algorithm for reranking here RF algorithm means the ranking method based on reciprocal rank fusion score that I mentioned on the previous slide you can find a lot of information about this method in the internet also in the elastic search database for example on this page you can see the formula that determines how to calculate the rank for each document so it seems like it couldn't be a big deal to implement this approach let's do it now I'm going to switch to our Jer notbook here we have the same environment and elastic search is running in the docket container in the background and uh now I'm going to open our previous uh notebook with a hybd search implementation as you remember how we can get started here first of all let's create a new section let's call it the ranking so next we can copy paste our H search function that we implemented on the previous step here is it and now we can just add a new [Music] parm rank our existing function I will add it here in search query and also let's rename our function can just add r to our function name and now I guess we're ready to call our function also we need here to copypaste question it's vector and the course name and function yeah one important thing that I forgot to remember that we need to use the elastic search of the appropriate version in the previous modules we uh launched elastic search in the do container elastic search uh with a version of I'm not mistaken yeah this one uh 8.4.3 so this version of the elastic search doesn't support our uh ranking algorithm I mean RF so we need to upgrade it we need to pull the docker image with a more recent version of elastic search it should be I'm not mistaken 8.90 yeah so you should launch this version of the elastic search to use this uh R ranking algorithm yeah now we can run ourselves here is our standard question and yeah here we expect to get an error as you can see according to the description of this error we don't have the appropriate license to use our reciprocal rank Fusion algorithm why we got this error so let's refer to to the documentation of the elastic search to be precise to the subcription plans so according to the subscription plans our free version of the elastic search doesn't support this reciprocal rank Fusion feature and that's the problem on the one hand we have functionality in elastic search that would help us to rank our results our documents uh we can say out of box but on the other hand this functionality isn't available in our free version of elastic search what can we do of course we can upgrade our version of the elastic search we can find maybe I don't know any PR version of the elastic search and run it but what uh if we will try to implement the RF functionality uh on our own so we we can just take and write our own function to calculate the ranking scores of course in uh this case we could rely on also on the documentation so here we have the formula how to calculate this R score we can just copy it and then Rew write our elastic search function that will take into account or this score on the stage of ranking our results R ranking of our documents yeah let's try to do it I just will clear this output now let's create new section called let it be uh yeah so I don't want to waste your time by Rew writing this code I will just copy paste the code that I prepared before and will explain some lines that is the most important I guess in this piece of code so what we have here so this function is a straightforward implementation of the our reciprocal rank Fusion function here we have just uh two parms the rank and the constant K if we compare our implementation it looks like this uh like this formula and uh the uh the left part and the r part is nothing more than our hybrid function uh in which I have made the several several changes let me explain what I did uh first of all I splited the hyd search into uh two parts uh as you can see here we independently make vector and keyword searches and each search returns its uh results with score after that we created the empty Target dictionary for the rence course uh then uh using the defin above RF function we uh calculated rence Force for the set of documents that were provided by the vector search then we repeat the same the same procedure for the documents that we got from the keyword search in in case of having the same uh do ID in the Target dictionary we just add the calculated their score to the existing values and then we just sorting our Target uh dictionary in in a descending order and finally we just return the top five documents with the highest values of this score yeah that's it now uh let's test our new modified function um I want just to copy paste the rest part of our pipeline so here we need the call of the function and also the evalation the call of the evaluation function uh let's rename this functions a little bit I believe that's all now we can try to run ourselves no yeah you need to Define our relation function of course yeah course we also need to import our ground Truth download our ground documents also our Matrix so we started our calculations and uh I guess we can also copy paste the results from our previous step when we implemented just a few hybrid Source without ranking yeah here we just using the embeddings for for the questions with with the answers with the text we are not going to to run our function for all types of embeddings I guess we can just take the last one because we get the best scores just on on this TR yeah of course it will take some time I just put my video on the pause and will return when it finishes so all the calculations took about 3 minutes as you can see we have improved each metric by by 2 or 3% it looks pretty good I think we can conclude that the document ranking has helped to improve our [Music] pipeline I think that we can stop here and wrap up in this video we discuss the concepts of the document ranking technique then we implement it we can say manually just by using the functionality of the elastic search and our make functions of course there are multiple other ways where we can build it especially using external tools or some other apis but it would be a topic of our next video so see you soon bye\",\n",

here so the cassin similarity is a good measure for the calculating the distance between two embeddings but may not necessarily be the best measure to actually reflect how relevant this Chun to the initial user query at least because in our case we use a combination of the search techniques but not only a vector search well move on and what about about the ranking in the elastic search let's add rest to the documentation there are multiple ways how we can Implement R ranking in the elastic search by using building function anality or calling the external models and apis I think we will start with a simple approach in our search function we can specify we can specify a special param called rank where we can pass ourf algorithm for reranking here RF algorithm means the ranking method based on reciprocal rank fusion score that I mentioned on the previous slide you can find a lot of information about this method in the internet also in the elastic search database for example on this page you can see the formula that determines how to calculate the rank for each document so it seems like it couldn't be a big deal to implement this approach let's do it now I'm going to switch to our Jer notbook here we have the same environment and elastic search is running in the docket container in the background and uh now I'm going to open our previous uh notebook with a hybd search implementation as you remember how we can get started here first of all let's create a new section let's call it the ranking so next we can copy paste our H search function that we implemented on the previous step here is it and now we can just add a new [Music] parm rank our existing function I will add it here in search query and also let's rename our function can just add r to our function name and now I guess we're ready to call our function also we need here to copypaste question it's vector and the course name and function yeah one important thing that I forgot to remember that we need to use the elastic search of the appropriate version in the previous modules we uh launched elastic search in the do container elastic search uh with a version of I'm not mistaken yeah this one uh 8.4.3 so this version of the elastic search doesn't support our uh ranking algorithm I mean RF so we need to upgrade it we need to pull the docker image with a more recent version of elastic search it should be I'm not mistaken 8.90 yeah so you should launch this version of the elastic search to use this uh R ranking algorithm yeah now we can run ourselves here is our standard question and yeah here we expect to get an error as you can see according to the description of this error we don't have the appropriate license to use our reciprocal rank Fusion algorithm why we got this error so let's refer to to the documentation of the elastic search to be precise to the subcription plans so according to the subscription plans our free version of the elastic search doesn't support this reciprocal rank Fusion feature and that's the problem on the one hand we have functionality in elastic search that would help us to rank our results our documents uh we can say out of box but on the other hand this functionality isn't available in our free version of elastic search what can we do of course we can upgrade our version of the elastic search we can find maybe I don't know any PR version of the elastic search and run it but what uh if we will try to implement the RF functionality uh on our own so we we can just take and write our own function to calculate the ranking scores of course in uh this case we could rely on also on the documentation so here we have the formula how to calculate this R score we can just copy it and then Rew write our elastic search function that will take into account or this score on the stage of ranking our results R ranking of our documents yeah let's try to do it I just will clear this output now let's create new section called let it be uh yeah so I don't want to waste your time by Rew writing this code I will just copy paste the code that I prepared before and will explain some lines that is the most important I guess in this piece of code so what we have here so this function is a straightforward implementation of the our reciprocal rank Fusion function here we have just uh two parms the rank and the constant K if we compare our implementation it looks like this uh like this formula and uh the uh the left part and the r part is nothing more than our hybrid function uh in which I have made the several several changes let me explain what I did uh first of all I splited the hyd search into uh two parts uh as you can see here we independently make vector and keyword searches and each search returns its uh results with score after that we created the empty Target dictionary for the rence course uh then uh using the defin above RF function we uh calculated rence Force for the set of documents that were provided by the vector search then we repeat the same the same procedure for the documents that we got from the keyword search in in case of having the same uh do ID in the Target dictionary we just add the calculated their score to the existing values and then we just sorting our Target uh dictionary in in a descending order and finally we just return the top five documents with the highest values of this score yeah that's it now uh let's test our new modified function um I want just to copy paste the rest part of our pipeline so here we need the call of the function and also the evalation the call of the evaluation function uh let's rename this functions a little bit I believe that's all now we can try to run ourselves no yeah you need to Define our relation function of course yeah course we also need to import our ground Truth download our ground documents also our Matrix so we started our calculations and uh I guess we can also copy paste the results from our previous step when we implemented just a few hybrid Source without ranking yeah here we just using the embeddings for for the questions with with the answers with the text we are not going to to run our function for all types of embeddings I guess we can just take the last one because we get the best scores just on on this TR yeah of course it will take some time I just put my video on the pause and will return when it finishes so all the calculations took about 3 minutes as you can see we have improved each metric by by 2 or 3% it looks pretty good I think we can conclude that the document ranking has helped to improve our [Music] pipeline I think that we can stop here and wrap up in this video we discuss the concepts of the document ranking technique then we implement it we can say manually just by using the functionality of the elastic search and our make functions of course there are multiple other ways where we can build it especially using external tools or some other apis but it would be a topic of our next video so see you soon bye In this video, we cover the topic related to the document reranking that were retrieved by the search algorithms on the previous step. We use Reciprocal rank fusion method to implement reranking in Elasticsearch.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"welcome back this is uh module six of the LM Zoom Camp so in this model we are speaking about different techniques how to improve our Rock pipeline in the previous videos uh we discussed such techniques as hybrid search and document ranking we implemented them just by using elastic search capabilities and in case of reranking we prepared our own ranking function based on the calculation of the reciprocal rank fusion score yeah that sounds great um besides in the previous modules of the LM Zoom camp we covered various topics related to LM orchestration uh recation also in one of the videos Alex demonstrated how to create a simple UI for our pipeline so in this way we use different tools and packages and uh spent a lot of time to build our end to end solution but what if we had a tool that would combine uh some of the steps and speed up the development process and decrease the whole uh time to Market so in such cases tools such as longchain come on a stage so what's L chain L chain is a tool or framing designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models as you can see it consists of different uh components and libraries some parts under the commercial use of course but um most of the libraries are open source longchain provides standard extendable interfaces and external Integrations for various components useful for building uh with LMS some components are built by a l chain um in other cases they rely on a third party Integrations sometimes they use a mix of solutions anyway longchain provides us out of the box functionality to create simple LM application build a chatboard or any kind of end to end rck pipeline so you can uh simply follow some of the some of these tutor else uh if you want yeah you're welcome so what we want to do in our case I think we will take the code from the previous videos where we implemented the hybrid search and documentary ranking and uh rewrite it using Lang chain framework and before we start I would like to notice that in this video we are not going to uh modify our preparation section um I mean the indexing stage as I mentioned in the first video we have two steps in in the Rock pipeline indexing stage and the retrieval stage on the indexing stage uh we pass our data F the database with it I mean we index uh documents in the elastic search and on the retrial stage we extract from the database the documents that the most um prevalent to to the user query and in our particular case we will not change this piece of code let's imagine um that we have already launched the elastic search in our U Docker container in the docker container and indexed our FAQ documents if you are interested in this topic U I mean how to index documents in the elastic search using the power of L chain I suggest you to refer to the documentation for example here on the elastic search tutorial Pages you can find uh the section about um chatboard implementation and one of this uh of the first steps here is the data ingestion uh this means how we can load spit and push our documents into elastic search using L chain packages and uh once again we don't want to change this part I mean this part uh and we we will proceed with the existing one therefore I have already created uh a new notebook and copy pasted uh the document indexing stage from our previous notebook let's call this section indexing stage yeah and this should be our retrieval part and uh we want to rewrite our this uh section I mean retal part using align chain and here is the good way to refer to the official documentation I think um as I mentioned before L chain consists of different components related to uh LMS and bedding models document loers Vector databases uh stores and so on and as we working with the elastic search as a key component in our pipeline for storing in and indexing our data it would be a good way just to find the component that is uh related to elastic search um where we can find it uh yeah and here is documentation that related to our elastic search component of course in order to use it we need to install uh the appropriate package and uh on this page we can find the explanation how to start to work with the uh elastic search so the key component I guess here the elastic SE Ser so object from the from the L chain but in our case I guess the most convenient way to interact with elastic search uh would be another component that called elastic search retriever so elastic search retriever is a wrapper under the elastic search uh client it's uh directly interacts with our elastic search client uh for example if we trying TR to implement some kind of search in our database it looks like uh we can say we call the search function from our base client and uh the most interesting thing I guess on this page is to how to implement the vector search yeah this part I just want to take this p of code just copy it and now we will try to rewrite it according to our query from the um previous notebook you just copy paste the queries for the keyword search and a for and now what we need we need to replace this part and this Vector search PA this example yeah and we also need to comment this line because as I mentioned before we are using elastic search uh with the pr subscription and our RF score metric isn't available by default in this free tril this fre trail version what we need else uh yeah so in this function I mean this uh example of HD search usage uh that we took from from a l chain we have a this embedding object so this embedding object is a model that we are using for building our Bings from our uh user query but uh as you remember in U in our previous notebook we just imported the model from the sentence Transformer package but this time we need to import this model or this object or class from the package of the L chain so uh well let's do it what else we need yeah of course we need to import this dict wrapper from the typing module and uh yeah of course we need to import our retrial yeah here is it um yeah the boosting of the question part and also make some changes so here we are building embedding inside our hybrid search function yeah and as you can see our hybrid search function returns both parts I mean keyword search dictionary and uh vectors search dictionary uh from the function and we pass this function into into the argument of our elastic saturat world to the body function and uh this is how it works also we need to pass the link or the URL to our elastic search as I told you us this under the put our standard uh elastic search client and also let's copy paste our test user query just to check it how it works and the course name [Music] yeah next build we also need to change it um here we are going to use our answers as a Content field so the answers from our documents from our FAQ I me and let's try to to use edding name is not defined I need to check the name oh yeah of course I just forgot to to download the model to assign it to this variable the name of power model here we want to use the same model as we did in our previous um in our previous notebook this one it's okay run it once again yeah and it works so this uh hybrid retriever that we used from L chain Library reduces the results the list of the answers the structure of the answers a little bit different from the our previous previous notebook from the results that we got in the previous notebook as you can see U blank chain produces its own uh document structure that contains uh the main part the main part that called page content if I'm not mistaken here lot of information yeah this page content this is the answers to our users query that we indexed in our elastic search database and uh the metadata contains some additional information about our records in the database like like the source section that can contains the section question names and uh course names also and also question IDs we can make a little bit simplify our output now let's save our results into separate variable we want to want to print the question let be need Source in this case and question field question let's say also first name and and the scores would be enough um yeah of course and here's our top results so if we want to output on the top cas I mean top five the most relevant documents from our database of course we need to pass um the size or we need to specify the size here there is it so well done now next step let's take the evaluation function the whole elastic search function from our previous notebook and uh let's try to rewrite the whole our pipeline just to calculate our scores like heat rate and RRM and this is our pipeline first of all we need to to read our ground for data file of course CU I want to call this section just H search this lines also so we need functions for calculating our Matrix our search hyrid function that uses the hybrid search function where we passing our query and this function also calls our elastic search Hy function and finally the evoluation meod and the only thing that we need to change here I think it would be our elastic search h function so these lines stay the same don't need to change our metrix functions so let's change this part uh so this is our elastic search client default client that calls the search function so we want to change this part by our new by our new function this our new part so let's leave this um method just inside our main elastic search fa function I think we don't need now the vector argument because we calculating embedding for our user query inside this function yeah and as a long chain using uh its own document format so we need to modify this part and just let's say we can take this function and our source is contained in the metadata check it now we can try to use our function just by passing one of the documents from our grand through data so let print the first element for data yeah we have question and the course of course so we need to pass to our function the following arguments field query and course I also need to change it name second argument is our commission the last one is the course name and uh yeah I Madeo yes seems like we get the correct [Music] results by the way you can also spfy on the fields [Music] here from the M that path yeah seems like it works the elastic search Hybrid function provided us the results we can check so our initial question is when does the course begin and here's the questions that he retri from our elastic search database that's the most relevant to our initial query so that means that we can now run the whole pipeline calculate our Matrix so let's do it so yeah let me check we need to add here question text Hy because we are going to use the embeddings of the not only the questions but also questions with answers uh we don't need this part because we are calculating embeding of our user query inside our hybrid query function we don't need this argument for course oh yeah now we can call our vation function finally while calculating our scores let's go to our previous notebook and find the results so we want to save these results and then compare them with the results that we will get after this calculation so it will take same time I just want to put the record this video on the on the pass and we will back soon so I am back and our calculations are completed and as you can see uh we' got the same results as last time in the previous notbook yeah because uh this markdown line I copy pasted from the our previous notebook and I guess that means that uh we did everything correct that's how it was supposed to be as we simply copy the existing working code and replace the Cod of of the original elastic search client to the um to the retrial component from the L chain but this component under the put interacts with the same elastic search client yeah so that's great and that's all oh for this video\",\n",

install right so so far this what we covered and then also Jupiter notebook juper notebook for experiments speep and run and maybe it's a good idea to also CD to notebook right uh now we also need to write a description like what exactly we are trying to solve and uh here I want to use chat GPT of course so I'll create a new chat and right now I'm going to put it on pause write a prompt and then uh read The Prompt and the results and then we'll just we'll copy paste it okay so this is the prompt I wrote I'm writing documentation for my course project then I I pasted the criteria that um we have in the course and I say that I need your help and then the project I'm working is AR application for fitness and gym I called Fitness assistant then next I show the data set right and then say how many records are there and then we can chat with the assistant so I describe what we can do with this and then I ask to write a read me file that describes a problem the data and what we do and I ask to use markdown code block for output so this is the output I copy it and of course we will need to edit it and by the way I also moved data to the data directory um so here we have it I will

description the data set using this project contains with various ex sizes data set was generating uspd and contains I like that um project overview Fitness assistant is a rock application I don't think we need that long thing uh for assisting users with their fitness routines I like that uh the features the main use cases I would say cases include exercise selection um exercise replacement ex instruction this is kind of not needed getting started and conclusions are not [Music] needed so let's see how it looks like problem description data set project overview M okay I think we can make it less con less uh verbose more concise example ask uh I recommend exercises exercise based on uh on type activity targeted muscle or will equipment uh replace an exercise uh uh with a suitable alternative uh and uh perform a specific exercise um um make it easy to get information uh without uh let say sifting through complex through manuals or websites I like it more so now it's more

look like a bit less uh generated even though it's generated uh yeah we know that but um like the moment I see that there's a bullet point and there's bolt uh name and then like clarification then it's clearly chargeability content okay we use pen like doing like making it um look like code you have people have installed installing dependencies running jupter notebook for experiments okay for now should be enough we will keep adding more stuff here um maybe we'll add a picture here but later okay so what do we have next so problem description um yeah we will of course include more here rck flow covered retrieval evalation so let's do that now so I want to um also this is something we need to mention in rbe also check the uh tips and best practices uh give a project me make it easier for evaluators to evaluate each of the criteria by mentioning them in your read me and including screenshots so this is exactly what we're going to do we're going to uh have a section of evaluation now and we have two things here retrieval and track wall and then also monitoring monitoring what else do we have inje continue ation reability I think like this is kind of self- explained if you see

I'm not sure this will be the final order maybe inje will put uh here um okay so coming back to evaluation so we will need to right now perform retrieval evaluation and also tune it a little bit cuz like when you look at the criteria um like if we just evaluate the approach we already have we will get only one point we want of course two points so we will also play with our mean search engine uh we of course can compare it with some other search engine but also we can play bit with weights uh but for now what we need to do is generate a data set so let me go to\",\n",

so I just want to randomly select some parameters with certain range within a certain range execute the function I have and then store the results and then at the end just return the results that I want um and yeah let's just try to see if this code that it gave us Works was it that f okay cool um so here this is uh objective function number iterations um so let's do that but for 10 iterations so what we are going to do our objective functions will be taking the validation I'll call GT validation well to dict or records and then executing that uh but before that um so I want to where is mean search search I want to use oops stop stop stop stop yeah click the wrong stop button it actually stopped recording the video anyways um so what I wanted to do actually is this one right right that should be reasonably fast and uh here the what we can also pass here to this function I'll put it here is uh boost right if Boost is none then it's empty but this is what we want to optimize right um so um param ranges will be uh what do we actually have here so for each of the document we want to have uh want to have different ranges right so exercise name so we want to now optimize boosting parameters so between zero and three let's say and for for all of them we want to try different boting parameters between zero and three to see which one is actually uh like the most important one at least for this 100 and yeah so how does our function work parameters current parameters here we pick a parameter objective function so this our objective function right so we will just pass parameters like that so we will take this as a dictionary and pass it objective function so let's Implement our objective def Che if params then will be our search function Q then return so I'm implementing this Lambda now uh pars right so this is our objective and now results evalate search function function return let's optimize for uh mrr mrr so this is our objective so this our param ranges this our objective uh here query boost so these are boost params cool and now let's just try to to run it we remove these things simple optimize evaluate um what do we have here par ranges objective function number of iterations so paramet ranges would be this one objective number of iterations 10 let's see what's the best results and if we can actually improve Mr at all I think we're doing it for 10 iterations um what why it's 05 are we actually maximizing it or minimizing it yeah so we are actually maximizing it so instead of do doing the best one we found the worst one see let's do it again so remember with no optimization it was uh 82 what is I think we need to debug a little bit it should be minus infinity yeah right that's why it didn't uh do anything yeah we want to maximize not minimize or we could have returned just minus Mr here and not change the code it's slightly better so we can just go with this right so exercise name is uh the most important type of activity is this important um yeah or we can also experiment uh instead of uh giving it uh like instead of integer we can maybe have like fractions not fractions but like um lot what is and let's do it for 20 diretion I'll put it on pause so you don't need to wait now it finished and now it's actually better right so we managed to improve it a little bit so let's see how well it performs on the entire data set so I'll create mean search improved how does it actually look like me search improved and then this is are the post parameters okay we perhaps don't need to have this long flots cool so we have the Boost now results and let's evaluate the that one more time so let's see what is the result okay this is the result we can see that on the entire data set the value is larger so I will copy this now and so the improved version with better Boos um give rate did not really change well maybe it's like just in one so if I look at this I I don't remember actually what was the number here so maybe I shouldn't do this but Mr improved and if we were optimizing for heat rate maybe uh yeah maybe we would have moved it too um but mrr actually makes sure that the relevant ones are higher in the results which is something we could have achieved also with uh uh query R ranking um but for now yeah let's just stick with that and we can also show the best boosting parameters okay so I think for now it's enough so we evaluated the retrieval uh we generated dat well we actually did a lot in this video so we um wrote started writing our readme file we generated the ground prooof data set we evaluated our retrieval and we also tried different approaches and found the best set of parameters for our retrieval and this video is quite long so let's stop for now and in the next video we will

rest I'll just call it uh um uh testing it so we have um URL which is this one um I'll I'll just use this P then oops your question then um I want to put it at the end cont type and then we have the

we can do is also include the question so then we can see what the question is uh maybe let me make it a bit easier um question so our question was in this one so then I just put question here I think I need to do something like this let's see cool so we have the question we have the answer uh and then we have our conversation ID which we can now send to um sending feedback uh ID this is the ID okay now let's send the feedback with this ID and make the script similar to this one edit a little bit Yeah it made it even more complex but uh I think we can just use this one feedback data um and then take this one and the URL is is feedback right and data is feedback data cool so for now it's okay um we have our inje um script we have our um interface I want to spend a little bit uh of time to describe um flask background maybe so here um I will say that we use flask maybe Technologies Technologies mean search uh for searching and uh let me find search me search for text uh text search uh then what do we use uh open AI uh s and llm then flask is the uh API interface interace see yeah background uh or more onk and I want to ask CLA to write U um to write a little bit about flask and what it is and how to use it so I'll put it on pause WR a prompt and then we'll talk about this so this is what I wrote um I use flask as a part of course project but since we didn't cover flask in the course I need to provide sufficient background for people to understand what it is write a few sentences about it in markdown format um so let's copy it and put it here flk um all right we use flask uh for like again I'll put it on pause edit it and then read what I have at the end and so this is what I ended up writing here we provide background on some tech note used in the course and links for third reading and then I just include a few sentences like we use Plus for creating the API for our application um and then for example uh we can send in our case we can send the question to http Local Host 500 uh was it questions or I don't remember question I think this should be sufficient right so like for example if you use a database that is not covered in the course you can just write hey like for example if you use quadrant quadrant is a database um for like vector database and then you just briefly describe what it is and then give a link for more information by the way let's check that this link is actually valid cool it is yeah okay so right now we tested it with curl and by the way you of course need to install uh curl uh if you don't have it alternative could be uh doing it with requests and then I can quickly show it to you so I'll do assistant P install def requests and by the way I need to also specify that when you install it you also need to install Dev dependencies um yeah um to also show that it works we can include um examples the answer could the answer will look like this Jon or uh you will see something like the four looping in the response and here after sending it you receive uh the acknowledgement okay um I'm just thinking if this should be like that uh I think it's kind of clear um what it is uh cuz yeah maybe let's uh make it explicit I'll think how to organize this later maybe you'll when you check the final version you'll see how exactly I put it here cuz like it feels like kind of lonely just one sentence for the entire section um but we want the reviewers to make it we want to make it easier for reviewers to actually review that in dets flask for interface so we need to be explicit about that so I'll think how to organize

       "  'text_vector': \"LLM Zoomcamp 7.6 - Summary and closing remarks significant and now I want to talk about R me so polished stre me file uh you can see this picture here maybe let me just go to here um so I polished the read me file I added uh so this picture is of course generated with AI so I used chpt to generate that um I just copied the like a few like this I think and ask hey can you generate a banner for my fitness assistant application something like that and like I did I made a few itations on that like it's kind of weird CU like dumbbell is kind of flying and uh I kind of know why this Rose of dumbbell is kind of inside the this thing but doesn't matter right so there is a picture it looks nicer so then I added like I moved things around here uh edited uh I also use chpt I asked chpt hey like can you please fix grammar and typos in my readme and then um I gave the entire content of this file and then update based on the feedback um so yeah you can of course you should take a look at that but I can just go through this and say what uh what I did there right so I added an example of how it should be used and ah yeah I I don't think I mentioned that so I also created a c application which this is how it looks like so you can ask it a question and then the app the CLI App application asks you like whether it was good or not which I demonstrate here then I also recorded a video that shows how to use a project and how to set up uh how to run this project on GitHub codes spaces I'll not open here you can check it uh yourself but is something you can also do uh in your for your own projects and I think uh especially if you use any uh I don't know if you deploy to the cloud and you don't want to keep your application running you can just record a demo show how to access this application and then turn it off right so then you don't need to pay for anything CU like if you create a database in the cloud if you create uh like is2 instance maybe you need to use something else then and like it can quickly add up uh so what you can do instead is just deploy it once record the video and then just have instructions of how to deploy it but anyways so this is uh the video check it out and then I think most of these things you saw like project overview data set I think I add a link to the data set here I describe the Technologies uh then I said what you need to do in order to prepare so install deeral get the key uh install ppen and install the dependencies then this is how you run it first you need to configure the database um and then you actually do Docker compose up and it works uh what if you want to run it outside of Docker what if you just want to run it with Docker without compul all these instructions are here then also this is the issue I struggled with uh for some time like making sure that time stamps are correct so I added a few checks here so you can read about that too um again hopefully if you try to reproduce it it shouldn't be a problem for you it was specific to my uh environment and then uh how exactly you can use it so once the thing is running how you can interact with uh with applications so for that there is the C application then also what I did is instead of just typing they c i can randomly load a question from the ground prooof data set which is what uh which is also what this test.py is doing previously it was sending the same request over and over again but now I thought um it would be nicer if it just picks a random question and then sends it okay and then example with curl then I describ the code what exactly we have like in the F Fitness assistant folder uh outside of it like this test.py clip um then I talk about the interface the for the API then ingestion uh then there's a section on experiments so this is where we did our evolation so evolation for retrieval which is uh a basic approach and then tuning uh our parameters and then evaluating Rock flow in our case we because we don't have a uh like the how to say uh like the answer the ground Ruth answer or the gold standard answer right we only have um we only have uh like a piece of text or not even a roll from a CSV file uh the only L is Judge mric we can use is like okay here's a question here's an answer like is it actually relevant or not and uh yeah evaluation of two and then for monitoring I added a screenshot of graph f a dashboard and then uh I also describe what kind of um tiles are there panels and actually to describe that what I did is I just took the dashboard of Json file put it to chpd and ask hey can you describe me what is inside and this is how you set up grafana so here I describe the files inside the grafana folder and this is how you run them right um so this is uh this is the project um Free LLM course: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp\",\n",
